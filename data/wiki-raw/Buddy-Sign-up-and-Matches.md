# REG Buddy Sign Up Sheet

This page is for organising sign-ups and matches to REG's [Buddy-System](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/buddy_system/). Everyone new-starter gets two REG buddies. In Jan 2022 we also had one external buddy. This helps to enforce that 'Turing' is bigger than 'REG'. External buddying is a little more social in nature, whereas internal buddies can wear both hats and also may offer informal technical help. However, note that the external buddying needs to be bidirectional and historically there hasn't been many volunteers from REG to the wider Turing, so external buddying should be considered an optional nice-to-have.

If your preference for being a buddy has changed, please contact the person in charge of onboarding [wiki page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/wiki/Onboarding).

Please add your name below if you'd like to be considered as a buddy for a new starter.

The only constraints to being a buddy are that the buddy is not the line manager or on the new-starters first project. Preferably, at least one REG buddy will also be available on the morning of the first day to great the new-starter.
