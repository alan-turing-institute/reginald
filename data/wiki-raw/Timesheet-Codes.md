# Our Approach to Timesheets

1. Timesheets should match Forecast.

   That is, if you are “100%” on projects, and have no service role activity, then your timesheet records 100% time on projects. For example, Town Hall meetings (which by the way is [standing role no. 617, Corporate Duties: Professional Activities not elsewhere specified](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/8)) would in general not be recorded on the timesheet.

2. However, if your other duties are taking up an inordinate amount of your time then you are very much at liberty to so record them in order to enable any conversations you would like to have about the issue. That is, the timesheet is also to help you push back if you would like.

3. However, in addition, we should (again, if you like!) record any activity in support of a Programme Support Role, Turing Service Area, or REG Service Area (like training) even if you are not explicitly assigned to that role so that we can start to figure out how much time these things really take up.

Remember again that Timesheets are to help us, they are not the source of truth for charging projects. We'd prefer that they reflect reality, rather than anything we have promised. But we don’t want them to be so fine-grained that they take up all our time to fill out. So, in particular: time allocated to projects includes a reasonable amount for corporate duties. Thus we don’t bother explicitly recording the corporate duties unless they become unreasonable.

Our actual process is: we charge projects based on Forecast, having made sure that there aren’t any glaring discrepancies with Harvest. (eg, a project starting a month late.)

# Which Project should I use for which activity?

This page describes where to find your project on Harvest. Every project on Harvest is labelled with a GitHub issue number, in the form `hut23-999`, so you want to find the project with the correct issue number.

## My project is a project

You should able find the project under the appropriate Client.

The issue number corresponds to the project as listed in [the project tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2) or possibly in [the 22 days project list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/4). (There may be other places but all projects have an issue number.)

## My project is Programme Support, Service Area, or other activity

All Programme Support roles and Service Area roles are listed on the [Standing Roles kanban board](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/8). The columns in that board each have their own Client on Harvest, where you should look for the particular role. Again, all the Harvest projects should be labelled with the appropriate issue number.

The clients are:
- Turing Programme Support
- Turing Service Areas
- REG Service Areas
- Corporate Duties
- Personal Time
