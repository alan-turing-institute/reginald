# Blog posts

We have also been given access to upload blog posts (Programme articles) to our page. After signing into your website account ([create one](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Comms/EQZgBleWlaNEiAFUy5RC7sQBAgTz9vwLHDRbewzI29B2WA) if you haven't):
1. Click on `Content` in the top left menu bar (you may need to click the three line "hamburger" icon first)
2. Click `Add content`
3. Choose `Article` content type

If you don't see the option to create a new article, ask a colleague from the [REG Communications service area](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/569) for help (see named assignees on the issue) OR request edit access yourself by following [these steps](#request-edit-access).

This will take you to a page where you can write and format your blog post. 

<b>Fields to fill out:</b>  
- Under `Type` choose `Programme`  
- Under `Related programmes` choose `Research Engineering`
- Also tick the `Research Engineering involvement?` checkbox

On the main REG page, the posts are shown in the Programme articles section. This shows an image, the title and a short excerpt for each blog post.

Make sure to upload an image when creating your post. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) is a good resource for finding suitable images.

You can specify the excerpt by either adding a subtitle to the page, or by adding to the `Summary` field (to the right of `Body` there’s an `Edit summary` option you can click on and add the desired text there, it won’t appear on the page itself). If none of these is specified, the excerpt will be the first line of the post from the `Body` section.

Once finished, under `Save as` choose `Ready for review` instead of `Draft`. This will send the post to the communications team for review and to publish.

Note that you can draft and get feedback on blog posts in the [Hut23-blog repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/hut23-blog/).
