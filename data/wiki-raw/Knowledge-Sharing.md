# Knowledge Sharing

## List of REG members and topics they are happy to be contacted about

We all have different overlapping skills but we don't do that well at learning from one another.

It is more fun and fulfilling to learn together rather than plough along in isolation. This page is a catalogue of members who would be happy to be grabbed for a chat on any of the listed topics.

Please, reach out on slack to anyone in the table if you're struggling with something, and perhaps even add yourself!

(if you want a wider net, you can post on #askaway, or #hut23).
