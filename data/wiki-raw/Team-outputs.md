# Other

A non-exhaustive list of published (or pre-published) outputs or public activities given by the team in reverse chronological order.

Types of output can be:
* Code
* Data
* Monograph
* Article (academic or otherwise)
* Preprint
* Public engagement
* Impact
* Radio broadcast
* Podcast
* Report
* [[Team Workshops]]
* [[Team talks]]
* [[Team community involvement]]

Public links to outputs can be shared widely outside the team.
If you are comfortable with your output being shared (and you should be for published works), then please add a public link to the output. If a public link does not already exist, please consider uploading your output to a public archive platform such as [figshare](https://figshare.com/), [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Academic outputs should, if they are to be counted in the [REF](https://www.ref.ac.uk/), be in an institutional repository (the Turing currently does not have one).

If you are not happy for your output to be publicly shared, then please consider sharing them within the team by placing a copy of your slides in the team OneDrive/SharePoint and sharing a link to the output as a private link below (right click the folder in OnDrive, select "Share" and then select the "People with existing access" option).

TODO: This table is not really adequate, and a proper repository and citations list is really needed by the Turing. We could do much better with a shared Zotero group to be honest.
