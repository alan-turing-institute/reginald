The new starter page has moved to the REG handbook:
https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/new_joiners/first_few_days/

See also the systems setup page in the handbook:
https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/new_joiners/systems_set_up/

Wherever you found a link to this page, it should probably be replaced with a link to one of the above pages.
