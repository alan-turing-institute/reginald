# Project shut down guidance

Some thoughts on how to shut down and successfully wrap up a project. Do join in editing.

* Use the 'Snark Hunt' process to debrief:
  * [Snark Hunt Guidance](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/strategy-and-planning/snark-hunting.md)
  * [Snark Hunt Template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/strategy-and-planning/snark-hunting-template.md)
* Make sure we put appropriate licences on the code so we can fork/copy it legitimately when the project ends
* Making sure that the main GitHub readme.md file is informative and useful, i.e. has a project description, information on how to install/use the software, contribute, get help
* Making sure that the GitHub repo is clean, i.e. no unnecessary issues, files, etc.
* Review the outputs to "[Defining Project Doneness](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining-done)" from the Handbook.
* Giving a talk to showcase the work / writing a blog post
* Submitting a paper, e.g. JOSS
