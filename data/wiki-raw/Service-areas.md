# What are service areas?

Service areas are non-project work that is done on behalf of the group or the wider institute.

- [Standing Roles Tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/8): Board showing all standing roles (support for Turing Programmes, Turing-wide service areas, REG-specific service areas). There's an issue for each project (see below).

### Programme Support

| Programme | People | Time allocated (FTE) | Time needed (FTE) | Looking for people? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Urban Analytics](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/561) | Greg | 0.1 | 0.1 (on average, though it fluctuates a lot during year) | |
| [Public Policy](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/560) | James R | 0.05 | 0.05 (few Public Policy projects need REG support) | No |
| [Health](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/559) | May | | | |
| [Finance & Economics](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/558) | Tim | | | |
| [Defence & Security](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/557) | Nick | 0.05 | 0 - 0.05 - most D&S projects go to ARC or Dstl team.  Depends on support of existing projects | |
| [Data-centric Engineering](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/556) | Eric | | Has fluctuated a lot recently due to evolution of DCE grant funding. Was 20% at its peak and this remains the current allocation, more recently has been more like 5%. New LRF grant is likely to cause this to go up again. | |
| [Data Science for Science and Humanities](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/555) | Oliver, Fede, Camila | 0.2 | Currently it's 0.2 divided between Science (Oliver at 0.1 and Camila at 0.05) and Humanities (Fede at 0.05). Officially the split should be half and half. Camila will cover for Fede while he's on parental leave. | |

| [AI](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/553) | Radka | 0.05 | 0 - 0.05, we haven't had any projects come through this programme | |
| [TPS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues/631) | Jim | | Too early to say | |
