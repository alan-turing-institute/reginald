# The Research Engineering Group Wiki

A repository of **knowledge helpful to the Hut 23 team** (aka, the Research Engineering Group or REG) including howtos and instructions for new joiners. 

**This wiki is visible to all members of the Everyone team** in the alan-turing-institute
organisation. (But some links point to documents that are private to REG.)

The [original wiki](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/wiki/Home) has REG-private information.

**This is a living document** 
- If you see anything that's out of date, please fix it. 
- If you would like to add something, the [[Knowledge Management Guidelines|Knowledge-management]] should help you decide whether it belongs in the wiki or somewhere else.
