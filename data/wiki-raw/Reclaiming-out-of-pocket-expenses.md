# Turing's Expense system

Out-of-pocket expenses should be reclaimed using Certify. You should submit an expense claim on Certify for expenses incurred within a given month as soon as possible after that month ends, and no later than 60 days after the expense is incurred (except for visa costs, which can be claimed up to a year after starting employment)

In the first instance, look at the information provided by the Finance team about how to use Certify on Mathison:

https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2169

(This also includes links to Certify's own user guides and videos)

Below is some information which is not covered by the Mathison page.

## How to deal with Receipts from YourTrip/Gray Dawes

Occasionally, receipts from bookings with YourTrip/Gray Dawes are automatically added to your Certify wallet, despite there being no out-of-pocket expenditure. (There are two ways to deal with this situation (we are waiting from guidance from Finance as to which one they would prefer us to do):

### Option 1 - submit it as a non-reimbursable expense

NOTE: @DavidBeavan was asked to clarify if option 2 was acceptable. As of 2022-09-15 no response from Finance.

In Certify, it is possible to edit an expense whilst it is still in your Wallet, to signify that an expense has already been paid for by the Turing, as shown below. Submit the expense as normal, meaning that there is a complete report of to the total expenditure for a particular activity, irrespective of how it was paid for:

### Option 2 Delete it from your wallet

The YourTrip/Gray Dawes booking system should ensure that it will be accounted for from the correct project budget.

Either way, be careful to ensure that you do not inadvertently claim for it as an out-of-pocket expense!

## How to add receipts to your Certify Wallet from a personal phone without the Certify App or Turing Email

Normally receipts (pdfs, screenshots, photos etc) can be sent as attachments from your @turing.ac.uk email address to `receipts@certify.com`. These will be automatically added to your Certify Wallet.

If you do not have (or want) your @turing.ac.uk email configured on your personal phone, and do not what to use the Certify App, there is a third option:

In the web interface, go to Account Settings. There it is possible to add a personal email address to your account (e.g. one you do have on your phone). Any attachments sent from that personal email address will also be added to your Certify Wallet).

## REG-specific budget information

### Check your "Default Project" is correct

In the web interface, go to Account Settings. Under the "User Information" heading, you should see your, Department, University and Default Project. For REG team members, this should look like:

| Department | Research & Software Engineering (RES-2130) |
| --- | --- |
| University | Turing (TUR) |
| Default Project | Research and Software Engineering (R-RSE-001) |


### Allocating your expenses to the right budget

* If one of your projects is paying for a conference, travel etc; In the "Add / Edit Expense" section, you should select “Yes” to “Turing Programme Project Expense?” and then search for the project (see screenshot). Your Expense Report will be sent to the appropriate PMU Programme Manager for approval.

* If your expense is not directly related to a project; In the "Add / Edit Expense" section, you should select “No” to “Turing Programme Project Expense?” and leave the "Project Name Lookup" blank (see screenshot). Your Expense Report will be sent to the REG Director for approval.

## Visa costs

If you applied for a Skilled Worker visa and were sponsored by the Turing, you are eligible to claim up to £4,000 back (though this is classified as a taxable benefit).
This has to be claimed within one year of starting your employment at the Turing.
See the [Relocation and Visa Allowance Policy on Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2270) for more information.

To do this, you will need the proof of payment sent by UKVI for both the visa application as well as the Immigration Health Surcharge payment.
As of 2023, these cost approximately £1,500 and £600/year respectively, so for a five-year visa the IHS bill should come to (somewhere around £3,000).

 - Save both emails as a PDF and add them to Certify as per the usual guidance.
 - Under 'Category', select 'Relocation Costs'.
 - Under 'Turing Programme', select 'Yes'. In the lookup field, type 'U-HRD-001' and select the one from the dropdown.
 - You can submit a claim that is larger than £4,000; the approver (Martin O) can 'limit' your compensation to £4,000.
   Alternatively, it should be possible to split an expense in Certify and to submit it as part reimbursable and part non-reimbursable.
   If in doubt about anything, it's a good idea to check with Martin.
