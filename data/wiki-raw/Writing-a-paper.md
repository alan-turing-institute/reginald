# Acknowledging Turing Funding

If you write a paper or another publication, you should cite Turing funding as follows:

* The Alan Turing Institute’s core funding is EPSRC grant EP/N510129/1. This is what to use when there is no more specific grant. Strictly speaking Turing Fellow projects are funded from the university partner contributions, but the core grant still covers overheads. I think we should generally reference this grant, even where we also reference a more specific grant, unless a project pays full economic cost (i.e. full direct + full overheads).

* ASG work is funded by the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund “AI for Science, Engineering, Health and Government” grant (EP/T001569/1), particularly the “<inset-theme-naqme-here” theme within that grant.

# Writing tips

## Books

A collection of books some of us found useful to get better at writing:

- **The Elements of Style** by Strunk and White
- **Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace** by Williams and Bizup
- **The Pyramid Principle:Logic in Writing and Thinking** by Minto
- **On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Non-Fiction** by Zinsser

Some of them should be already available at the Turing.
