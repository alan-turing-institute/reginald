# Shared REG Calendar

We can use the calendar associated with sharepoint group `Research Engineering` for events we want the whole team to know about. You should already belong to this group (see [Systems set up](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/new_joiners/systems_set_up/#office-365-groups)).


## Viewing the calendar

In outlook calendar view, `Research Engineering` will be listed under `Groups`. If you keep this ticked then the shared calendar entries will appear alongisde your existing calendars.

If you also want to view the shared calendar in the default macOS Calendar app:

1. Open the Calendar app, then go to Settings > Accounts > Delegation
2. Click the '+' sign and in the 'Users' field, select `Research Engineering (hut23@turing.ac.uk)` (you can just type hut23 and choose it from the dropdown).
3. Once that is added, make sure that the checkbox under the 'Show' field is ticked.
4. The shared calendar should then be visible under 'Delegations' in the left-hand sidebar.


## Making Editable calendar entries.

If you want to make a calendar entry that other REG members can edit you should do this from the calendar view with the `Research Engineering` calendar selected (as in the screenshot). Anyone else in the `Research Engineering` group will be able to view and edit the entry (since `Research Engineering` will be the owner of the event).

Note that invites to the group will only be sent out if you add, to the attendees, the `Research Engineering` group, or `hut23@turing.ac.uk` (the email associated with the sharepoint group).

## Making Read-only calendar entries.

If you want to add read-only calendar entries, you can invite `hut23@turing.ac.uk`, the email associated with the group `Research Engineering`, to your event from your own calendar (i.e. so you, not `Research Engineering`, is the owner). Inviting `hut23@turing.ac.uk` will send an invite out to all members of the sharepoint group.
