** How we currently manage our portfolio of projects

1. For *overall project management* we use [[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2][the `Project Tracker']], a kanban board
   attached to the hut23 repository on GitHub. (Confusingly, GitHub calls a
   kanban board a “Project.”)  Each project gets a GitHub “issue,” which comes
   with an auto-generated issue number. The issue number is the primary means of
   individuating projects within REG.

   Each of the issues lives in a particular column of the kanban board
   representing the present stage of the project. We currently have ten stages for a project, which are described below.

   | Stage | Name                   | Description                                   |
   |-------+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
   |     1 | Suggested              | Someone heard a rumour                        |
   |     2 | Proposal               | Someone is writing a proposal                 |
   |     3 | Project brief complete | We have received a project brief to consider  |
   |     4 | With funder            | Appoved by REG; awaiting funding confirmation |
   |     5 | Finding resources      | REG is finding individuals to assign          |
   |     6 | Awaiting start         | Project is ready to go                        |
   |     7 | Active                 |                                               |
   |     8 | Completion review      | We don't do this as much as we should         |
   |     9 | Done                   |                                               |
   |    10 | Cancelled              |                                               |

   Within the issue itself we maintain metadata about the projects---the people
   involved, the total budget and timing constraints---as well as a
   chronological record of communications about the project. We also use the
   issue as a place to attach team members’ preferences. None of this metadata
   is easily parsed by machine, although we have recently made efforts to add,
   at the top of the issue, [[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project.md][a metadata block]] containing the critical information
   for each project.

2. For *scheduling* and *billing* we use [[https://forecastapp.com/974183/schedule/projects][Forecast]]. Roughly speaking, this
   web-based service maintains a list of /assigments/: that is, allocations of
   an individual's time to a project over a given period. Since Forecast records
   what we ought to be spending our time on, we also use it for billing. When we
   come to to decide how much to charge projects we look at the past
   allocations in Forecast.

   We have also used Forecast to try to schedule projects as well as individual
   assignments. However, this is complicated by the fact that there is no
   "project budget" facility in Forecast. There is no place to record start and
   end dates or resourcing needs for projects that are not yet staffed. (This is
   why this information is in the Project Tracker.) We have found a work-around
   by assigning a nominal staff member (known as a “Placeholder”) called
   “Resource required”. When a real team-member is assigned to the project, the
   “resource required” person is removed. However, this approach has been made
   more difficult by the decision to move to staffing levels that are not
   necessarily multiples of 50% of an FTE.

3. For historic *time tracking* we use [[https://thealanturinginstitute.harvestapp.com/time/week][Harvest]], a system linked to Forecast.

We have tried to use Harvest to track our /actual/ time, including various
   duties that are not billed to projects because they are part of "business as
   usual."  Every once in a while we review Harvest to ensure that what we said
   we were going to do (in Forecast) is roughly what we actually did. If there
   are large discrepancies, we discuss these and if necessary change Forecast
   retroactively to match reality.


In addition, we have written a number of scripts under the collective name
“[[https://wimbledon-planner.azurewebsites.net/][project Wimbledon]].” These (a) summarise staffing allocations by project and
person, to some extent reproducing the board in a way that allows us to print it
out on a very large sheet of paper; (b) collect in one place the individual
preferences; (c) produce a forward look of supply against demand.
