**New starter offers:** When making offers to prospective new team members, we make fixed, non-negotiable offers at one of the three fixed baseline points within the overall salary band for the role (i.e. the 0/3, 1/3, 2/3 points). When determining these offers, we consider candidates’ previous experience and consider who their closest future peers are within the existing team. Deciding which of these points represents a fair starting salary for a future colleague based on two hours of interviews can sometimes be challenging but we work very hard to be as confident as we can be that we are not being unfair to either current or future team members and, when the decision is not straightforward, we consult widely with those who interviewed the candidate to ensure we have the best possible input to make the best decision we can.

**Promotion:** On promotion, people will be appointed at the bottom of the salary range for the role.

### 2021-2022 Institute-wide HERA Bands
Effective: 01 April 2021 - 31 March 2022; Cost of living award from previous year: 1.5%

**Note:** In 2021-22 REG salaries were only partially aligned with the HERA bands below.
Junior and Standard were fully aligned but we did not yet have the Band 5 Lead role defined and Principals had not yet been formally mapped into Band 6. 
Senior salaries spanned all of Band 4 and some of Band 5 due to the effect of cost of living increases from previous years on salaries within the previous REG-specific Senior salary band of £45,0000 - £60,000 (which had not had its minimum and maximum salaries adjusted in line with the cost of living increases applied to individual salaries). 

| Role      | Band | Role Salary Min | Role Salary Max | Bottom third baseline | Middle third baseline | Top third baseline |
|-----------|:----:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| Principal | 6    | £66,000         | £75,500         | £66,000               | £69,167               | £72,333            |
| Lead      | 5    | £56,000         | £65,500         | £56,000               | £59,167               | £62,333            |
| Senior    | 4    | £46,000         | £55,500         | £46,000               | £49,167               | £52,333            |
| Standard  | 3b*  | £37,000         | £45,500         | £37,000               | £39,833               | £42,667            |
| Junior    | 3a*  | £34,000         | £36,000         | £34,000               | £34,667               | £35,333            |
