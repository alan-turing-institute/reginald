# Project start up guidance

@fedenanni and @DavidBeavan have been leading some thinking on project-startup, and some best practices and checklists to consider when getting a new project with a new partner successfully going. Do join in

TODOs
- [ ] Schedule another co-working session
- [ ] Integrate with Turing Way - a new chapter?
- [ ] All: iterate and improve

# REG on a new project: a check-list

## Welcome to the Tech Talk
* Intro
* Goals - Turing Way chapter?
* 5mins (ish) on each heading below
* Join us in the discussion
* Help us with notes

## :arrow_right: Want to join us for more and write up, scroll to bottom and put your name down plz :arrow_left: 

## Promo

Your brains :brain: needed. Join @fedenanni and me on :calendar: Tuesday at 12.30 for a REG Tech Talk on project start-up essentials :rocket: and how to get going with new collaborators :linked_paperclips: . Would make a lovely Turing Way chapter :book:  https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/356411961?pwd=Tjloa2t0OHFzUGVaNG9xRmxxSGVxZz09

## Expectations

Communicate expectations e.g. does know the start/end/REG effort?

Communicate that we're often on multiple projects and how that affects work and time.

Are there particlar days REG is on or off the project?

"setting up the setting of expectations" from REG leadership as well?
  - "Someone will be starting to work on your project soon. They will set some expectations that might look like X. This is because they work on more than one project. For example, one week for your dedicated team is something like 2 days for a 0.5FTE REG member."
  - Nipping behaviour in the bud is more desirable over explicit(repeated?) pushback
  - none of this should be a surprise to the PI, if it is, how can we make sure they have these expectations from an earlier stage (PMU? scoping?)

Should we remind projects that if we are 0.5FTE this corresponds to 2 days a week?

Code of conduct / contributor guidelines / ways of working

What are the immediate pressures and risks on the project?

This is often a learning experience for REG too

For projects which don't have an immediate product or vision, working together on a backbrief is a usful initial exercise.

Time commitment and risk / pressures could have happened before in the project scoping

## Meeting routine

Decide early on the type of meeting routine and if no one is leading on this, maybe take it under your wing. In LongNLP the PI is handling many other meetings and projects at the same time so she was happy to delegate the organisation of standup meetings etc to us.

I would suggest weekly standups with a quick overview of the project board and once a month a longer meeting with proper longterm planning (this is the Safe Haven project approach). Then of course in between specific calls but not recurring meetings.

Are meetings better over asynchronous working?

Could meeting schedule support 1 week on, one week off REG working, if desired?

Weekly meeting a la Safe Haven, with round-table discussion and making sure all issues are visitied and updated.

Does it work well having one planning meeting (project board, scrum style) and then other ~~meetings~~ co-working sessions to do the creative work, but with limited membership to those who are stakeholders or responsible for the doings. 

## Agile working

Does everone know agile working practices? How to encourage project-wide team to use

In Living with Machines we have two different types of project boards. The first type is for having overviews of broad tasks in the whole project, and we use them also for keeping meeting agendas. I am using it for instance [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Living-with-Machines/projects/40), inspired by the [REG EDI](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/6) project board.

The other type of project board is specifically dedicated to a work package (for instance a paper or a tool.) and could be used for weekly standup meeting agenda.

## Informal communication

If all people are already on the Turing Slack that could work quite well. Basically setting up one or more dedicated channels with associated names (lwm-main, lwm-nlp, lwm-reg, lwm-animacy). If the collaborators are external or the project could become a long-running work they might prefer an independent Slack. In that case I would suggest to use it also for handling communications with stakeholders and participants to workshops (in LongNLP we have private channels for members of the projects and public for people interested in the work)

* Asynchronous decision making can be more inclusive. Everyone has a chance to participate, not just those who are on Slack at that time.
* Output of a synchronous (e.g. Slack) conversation needs to be captured somewhere persistant (e.g. GitHub issues) for posterity

- (might not belong here) get feedback from PIs at
    - The end of the project
    - After 4-8weeks to check progress and ways of working are, erm, working

## Reading groups (as a co-learning experience)

Be up-to-date with the literature, share knowledge across disciplines.


## How to keep the project informed of your schedule / other meetings / days off

LwM people have access to my calendar and we have a synced calendar - but this does not work for all projects.

Useful on some projects to have a (rough) timeline from the start, including upcoming holidays etc.


## Code

Other things we could mention:

- branches / code review

Does everyone know how to use git / gitflow / merge


## Data access

Azure storage accounts?

Data Safe Haven?

## Outside the REG box
* Let's get input from PMU/TPS and wider coleagues
* Also from PIs, other REG collaborators and groups
* Other RSE groups too?
