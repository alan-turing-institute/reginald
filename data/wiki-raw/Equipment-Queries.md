### Standard Equipment

- You should have received a MacBook Pro either before or on your first day, contact your line manager urgently if this hasn't happened.
    - Once your IT credentials are set up (see point 2) In addition to the standard MacBook Pro you can request peripherals such as a monitor, keyboard and mouse [here](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=eee3b659bb3e4ab5aaed67f807ebd8c3&openedFromService=true).

### Getting a New Computer

This is a list of the steps I, James G, took when I got a new laptop from IT.

- [ ] Sign in to Apple Cloud on new machine. Activate all accounts (Office365, personal email, ...)

- [ ] `brew cask install emacs`, and anything else you need.

- [ ] In my case, I store config files on Apple Cloud, and symbolic link them to their required place, eg:
  * `~/.emacs.el`
  * `~/.bash_profile`

- [ ] Office (including OneDrive): I installed with the new "self service" app that IT now bundle with laptops (which apparently installs things via homebrew!)

- [ ] OneDrive setup. I have a personal shared space on OneDrive, but also multiple shared spaces for projects, set up as "Groups" in Office 365. The standard location that Office chooses for your local OneDrive image is annoyingly long and full of spaces. So I put all shared spaces in ~/OneDrive-Actuals and then symbolic link to ~/OneDrive (for my personal space) and ~/Share/X (for project X).

- [ ] SSH tokens for GitHub. I made new ones. I had thought about moving them, but it turned out to be straightforward to make new ones.

- [ ] Go through every repo with an authoritative remote, make sure I've pushed all local commits, and delete. (I keep all repos in `~/Projects/`, with remotes usually on GitHub.)

- [ ] Double-check other directories within `~/`

- [ ] Install Emacs additions as I learn that I need them ...


### Additional Equipment

 -- what there is and what you would like?


- If there are health and safety reasons why you would want equipment that differs from the Apple keyboard/mouse then contact HR directly, there is a separate health and safety budget for such things.

### Office Furniture

- The Turing also offers furniture for home working such as a desk or a chair. At the time of writing (Dec 2021) the budget per person is £150 for a chair and £150 for a desk. You can pick your own, the usual routes are through Amazon or [Office Furniture Online](https://www.officefurnitureonline.co.uk/). Anything more than £150 and they will have to purchase themselves then claim back up to £150 via certify. The official process is to assess your home-working set up via a [workstation self-assessment](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=6100f533868f4165bcadd1b5f2050a08) form, but you can also just email facilities (facilities@turing.ac.uk) and be nice.
