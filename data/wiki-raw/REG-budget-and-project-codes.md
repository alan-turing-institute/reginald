## Project codes
Project codes determine the source of funding that ultimately pays any cost.  They look like `R-XYZ-999` or sometimes `R-XYZ-ABC`.

Project-specific costs should be charged to the individual project code. This will ensure costs are billed to the project budget. You must ensure that the project's PI or programme manager is happy for a particular cost to be charged to a project before doing so.

Costs related to the team rather than a specific project should be charged to project code `R-RSE-001`. This will charge the cost to our team's core budget. This is a limited source of funds and therefore costs should only be charged to this if they cannot be charged to a project.

Project codes should be in the structured information at the top of the corresponding issue on our [Github project board](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2). If it is missing for one of your projects, please refer to the section below, and update the project issue with it.

### How to find (or update) a project code

The primary, trustworthy source of project codes *within REG* is **Forecast**.  All projects on Forecast are listed, along with their project code (where we know what this is), on the [Forecast Project page](https://forecastapp.com/974183/projects).  The project code for a given project will appear as a grey 'tag' underneath the name of that project, with text like `R-XYZ-999`.

When looking up a project code, please:
- Check that the project is really the one that you intended.  Note that a few projects have the same, or similar-sounding names.  The most reliable way to check that you have found the right project is to check the GitHub issue for that project -- pay particular attention to the project's **end date**.
- Does the Forecast project correspond to the correct phase of work?  A few projects had or have multiple funding sources, and therefore multiple phases with different project codes.
- If you are in doubt, please check in the first instance with the REG Challenge Lead for the programme that the project falls under (they are grouped by 'Programme' on the above page).
- If you are charging a project, particularly for large amounts, such as for REG time, is the relevant Programme Manager aware of this?

**Do not edit the project codes yourself**.  If a project code is missing or incorrect, it may be tempting to add or edit it, but please instead **let the relevant Challenge Lead know**, who will get in touch with the PMU colleague who looks after that project.  It is important that both the Challenge Lead and the Programme Manager know about a code being added or changed. The REG Challenge Lead 'owns' the projects under their Programme on Forecast, and the PMU is the ultimate source of this information.

**For challenge leads:** To edit a project code, click on the project in the above list, then you can edit the tags.  The tag should be all uppercase, and consist of just the code (for example, `R-RSE-001` for internally funded projects).

## Budget codes
Budget codes classify the type of the expense. It is important to classify expenses correctly for the
institute's accounts, and different types of expense can be treated differently for tax, so it is
important to pick the right budget code for a particular expense. REG generally use only a subset of
these codes, so please talk to Martin before using one of the non-common codes for the first time. In
general travel, subsistence and accommodation should be handled by the outsourced provider, but there may be cases where this is handled outside of the system (e.g. reimbursing a speaker).

The budget codes are constructed from the REG department code `RES-2130` plus a common expenditure code used across departments. If you are specifically asked for a department code, quote `RES-2130`.
