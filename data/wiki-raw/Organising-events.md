_This guide was put together after organising several workshop/teaching events.
Generally the Events team and others in the Business team will be able to help with managing events, but the notes below may be useful if you ever end up self-organising an event.
If you have a different experience, please edit!_

## Booking Enigma

Enigma fills up early, especially if you need more than one day for your event.
As a general guide, look at least two months ahead if you want a reasonable amount of choice.

- Look at the Turing Calendar\* and find a good time.
  Those marked "Events hold" _may_ be free, but you'll need to check with Events.
- You can book Enigma either via Reception or Events.
For smaller meeting rooms, book through a calendar invitation or Reception.
  - Reception: Fine for small events, but remember that you won't get as much support with the organisation.
  - Events team: Booking via the Events team is a longer process - you will need to fill in a five-page [Event Application Form](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/search?q=KI%200531) and send it to the Events team.
  They will get in touch within a few days to discuss dates and other arrangements.
  You'll also get support for registration, website etc. if needed.
- If you are arranging a large event, you might need to book another room (usually Lovelace) for catering.

\*In Outlook, go to `Organize`, then click `Open Shared Calendar` and search for "Turing Calendar".
Note that this calendar also includes events held elsewhere, but there isn't a way to see a separate list for Enigma only.
You can also add the calendars of the other meeting rooms in the same way.

## Event times

Starting after 9:30am
- The main entrance to the British Library opens at 9:30am.
- Once inside, attendees can get their visitor's pass from Reception.
- You should provide a list of attendees to Reception a couple of days in advance of the event.
- Make sure to inform attendees that
  - There is often a queue to enter the British Library.
  - Bags larger than airline carry-on size are not permitted in the library.

Starting before 9:30am
- Attendees will need to use the staff entrance.
- You should provide a list of names to Reception and make sure the list also gets sent to the staff downstairs.
- Someone will need to bring the attendees from the staff entrance up to the Turing.
  This can be inconvenient, so starting the event later is generally preferable.

Ending after 5:30pm
- Talk to the Events team if attendees will be in the Institute later than 5:30pm. Approved members of staff will need to be present if non-Turing attendees are in the office after this time.

## Catering

- Catering should be ordered at least **two weeks** before the event.
  Reception can send you an order form, or you can book via [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=2e1700436eca4c9c94c48f6bb867ef28&openedFromService=true).
- You can make small changes to the order (for dietary requirements etc.) up to a couple of days before the event.
- Menus and prices can be found on [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=72414dd01d6246b2a18d0fa5bb58e4c3&from=ad1b4d94-81d7-4ce3-b8d0-fd5552de1b8b).
- To pay for catering, you will need to supply a nominal code and a project code.
  If you are using funding from an external source, talk to Reception about setting up a purchase order (the Turing will make the payment and then reclaim from the other funding source).
- Make sure to ask about dietary requirements on the registration form.

## Publicity

- The Events team can create websites for events.
- The Turing Bulletin is sent out every Thursday afternoon.
  Email `communications@turing.ac.uk` before the end of Wednesday to have your event included (<100 words).
- Slack: `#events`, `#interesting-events` etc.
- Twitter: `@turinghut23`

## Room setup for workshops

Capacity guides for theatre, boardroom and other styles can be found in the [meeting request form](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=e27b71da716e4292948072e7fdfccd22&from=1dd2ca46-25c4-4dec-b364-ea27232ad5de&openedFromService=true).
If you hold a workshop with a different setup, please add it below so that others can use it as a guide for capacity in future.

### General notes

- If you need a microphone, get in touch with Dan (`dwhitfield@turing.ac.uk`) well in advance of the event.
- You can find spare extension cables in a box on the shelves behind the door of Enigma.
- There might not be enough tables for workshops in Enigma - make sure to check with Reception if you need more than eight.

### Enigma

#### 40 people around five large tables (Spark workshop)
- Eight people per table (made up of two smaller tables).
- Some chairs didn't have a good view of screens.
- Plenty of room for helpers to walk around.
- Extension cables got to three tables easily.
- Microphone was definitely needed.
- Not enough tables; had to borrow from Lovelace.
  We needed two tables to make up the final work table, and two more for catering (tea and snacks only; more tables would be needed for full catering).

#### 35 people around 8 small tables (RSE with Python course)
- 4 or 5 people per table.
- Fairly crowded for helpers to walk around, but small tables were good for group work.
- Tables borrowed from Lovelace.

### Lovelace Suite (3 rooms)

#### ~18 around three tables (Binder workshop)
- Catering on tables at the back of Lovelace.
- Microphone would have been useful - hard to hear from back of the room.
- This was an unusual setup so Reception needed help moving tables and chairs.

## To add

- Registration.
  I (Louise) haven't managed the registration process for any events yet.
  I'd recommend asking someone from the Events team, who may be able to manage the process for you or show you how they use Eventbrite.
