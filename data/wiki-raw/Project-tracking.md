# Tracking projects and other tasks

We use GitHub extensively for tracking projects and other tasks within the team.

## Hut23 Repo

The [Hut23 repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23) is the central hub for most team matters and admin.

- [Project Tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2): Board showing all upcoming, current and completed projects. There's an issue for each project (see below).
- [Issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues): Each project has an issue following a common template, including a general description of a project and its current status, for example. There are also issues for service areas and other activities/organisational issues for the team.
- This Wiki contains generally helpful info about all things REG. This includes [[Team outputs]].
