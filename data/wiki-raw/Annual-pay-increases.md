Annual pay increases at the Turing have two components.

## Cost of living award
On 01 April each year, an unconditional, universal, **cost of living** increase is made. All staff receive this award, regardless of probation status or performance. This increase also moves the top and bottom of each pay band up by the cost of living percentage.

### Historic cost of living awards and comparison with UK official inflation statistics
For reference the cost of living increases for previous years are listed below, along with the two most recent month's CPIH figures that would have been available to the Remuneration Committee of the board of trustees when setting the CoL increase (that January's and the previous December's as there is a delay of a month or few in publishing each month's CPIH figures).

## Progression award
On 01 July each year, progression awards are made in addition to the cost of living award made each April. These progression awards depend on the outcome of the annual appraisal process, which takes place in May/June of each year.  See [[Annual appraisals]] for more details of this process.

### Principles
1. REG folk who are operating at an equivalent level should receive equivalent pay.
2. We are a learning team and our default assumption is that people will generally be growing and developing in their role as they gain more experience.
3. Everyone who is performing and developing as expected for their role and their experience level within it should expect to progress through their pay band each year on top of the cost of living adjustment. This is very much in line with the guidance on salary increases from HR (see below).

### Mechanism
- All team members who have been performing and developing as expected for their experience level will receive the same "small" progression increase in pay each year above the cost of living increase. The actual percentage increase this corresponds to is set by HR each year but the expectation is that, if performing and developing as expected each year, you would progress from the bottom to the top of your band in around 6-8 years. This is in line with the expected progression rate in the university spine point system.
- Exceptionally, where someone has progressed significantly more than what would reasonably be expected, a further adjustment may be made to ensure that Principle 1 still holds.
- Where someone has been promoted within the year, they will already have received their progression pay increase for the year at promotion and no further progression increase will be awarded at appraisal time.
- In the rare cases someone in the team is not performing or developing as expected, no progression increase will be awarded. This situation should be managed via ongoing support throughout the year. In general, this should not be a surprise at appraisal time.
- Team members who are at the top of their pay band are not eligible for a progression pay rise, but they are eligible for a bonus if consistently performing at a high level.
