## More details

Turing's Research Engineering Group aims to provide regular, informal, community-led sessions where students & researchers can come along to ask questions about technical problems or challenges, or to ask for general technical advice. The sessions offer a friendly and welcoming, non-judgemental environment where you can ask for technical advice or assistance without concern about being judged on your level of technical knowledge, expertise or understanding.

As our organisers and helpers know, many of us working with software in the research community have been trained in domains where computing has not traditionally been a key element. There can be lots to learn in terms of new jargon and technical skills and we all have to start somewhere.

We can help with:

- **General programming problems** including helping to identify and fix bugs.
- **Cloud computing questions** including how to get started on Azure.
- **Software sustainability:** best practices for testing, managing and packaging your code.
- **Reproducible research:** advice on ensuring that your software is developed in a manner that supports long-term reproducibility of research outputs, including techniques for packaging and archiving code.
- **High Performance Computing (HPC) support and advice:** we can offer support and advice on the HPC resources available at the Turing.

## Joining sessions

Our weekly sessions run for one hour from 13:30-14:30 every Tuesday and are hosted on Zoom and in person (details at the top of the page). Everyone is welcome to drop-in at any time. There's no need to register in advance.
