_aligned with Turing 2.0 and the Turing Charter_

## 1. Impact
_Make a positive change in the world_

The Institute works with an impact-first philosophy, focusing on research that is likely to make a positive change in the world. Impact in this context is understood broadly, from increased knowledge and understanding of the way we see and operate in the world, to increased efficiency resulting from the uptake of new tools and technologies. Impact also drives the way our project delivery is managed. In assessing project proposals requiring data scientist or research engineer effort, we will prioritise approaches and methodologies we are familiar with and confident that they can produce impactful results. Each project will be assigned a score based on the impact opportunities it presents and the likelihood of realising them. 

## 2. Diversity 
_Reflect and celebrate the diverse nature of the world_

In order to be able to change the world for the better, our research must be conducted by researchers from diverse academic, social, ethnical, racial backgrounds, and using a variety of theoretical frameworks, methodologies and categories of data. Diversity breeds creativity and enables discovery and innovation to flourish. This approach is matched at project delivery level by prioritizing projects building cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary collaborations or bringing partner institutions together. Project proposals involving purely theoretical research with academics, or consultancy-type work with commercial partners, or not welcoming external contributions from outside the REG, are unlikely to score high in the diversity assessment. Conversely, projects encouraging collaboration with culturally diverse academic and non-academic teams from beyond the Turing are likely to get higher marks.  

## 3. Pioneering 
_Explore new ways of tackling research, talent and approaches_

Turing research is solidly rooted in academic excellence, scientific evidence and trusted best practice. At the same time the Institute works creatively, encouraging new ideas and unprecedented approaches to pursue scientific excellence in addressing critical global challenges. Cross-pollination of ideas and practices leading to innovative results is encouraged in collaborative projects with academic, commercial and third sector delivery partners. Project briefs will need to specify to what extent the proposed approaches or methodologies are innovative in the context of similar research being undertaken elsewhere, and a pioneering score will be assigned to each of them. 

## 4. Openness 
_Share outputs and methodologies as openly as possible_

To ensure that our collaborative research reaches an audience as wide and diverse as possible, we believe both knowledge and the path to reaching it should be shared. Openness by default facilitates both research and software development collaboration. This extends the impact of our projects beyond the Institute, allowing outputs to be built upon by others and repurposed across domains. Whenever possible, we expect the projects we prioritise to undertake reproducible research, and the software jointly developed with us to be built and released as open source. Project proposals with realistic plans on meeting this priority will get high marks in the openness score. 


## 5. Alignment with Turing 2.0 
_Prioritise activities reflecting Turing 2.0 guiding principles_ 

[Turing 2.0](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2093) represents the next phase of the Institute – delivering on an ambition to be a truly national institute for data science and AI. Achieving this will mean operating differently to how we do now and having a clearer focus to guide the work we undertake, across science and innovation, skills and engagement. In consultation with the Board of Trustees and Institute’s Research Leadership and Turing Management team, a set of initial [guiding principles](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=Turing+2.0+principles+and+future+activities+March+2022.pdf&fileguid=a8f5af29-20fd-4d25-bdbc-3fa42e561fc9) that will shape Turing 2.0 have been formulated.
