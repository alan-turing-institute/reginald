## Guides on managing projects

### Agreeing to do projects

- New projects to be presented for consideration at our montly Project Allocation Meetings should be summarised using this online form:

### Finding people for projects

1. If you are a Programme Lead: please keep track of which new projects are coming up in the next 6 months, and ensure there is a Senior REG person assigned to these. To do so, badger the “staffing coordinator” (currently James G at 10 November 2021). 

2. Project Leads (that is, the most senior REG person on the project): please ensure that your project is resourced. This means ensuring that there are people to start. It also means checking the total “budget” for the project and making sure we will meet it. To do so, badger the staffing coordinator.

Note that (2) is not entirely straightforward because projects are no longer staffed in integer multiples of 0.5 people for a fixed number of months. Sometimes we allocated, say, 0.8 people for a while, which means that either the project run-rate will need to increase or the project duration extended. 

### Problems and issues

Occasionally, issues arise on projects which require escalation. If this happens to you, and you are the most senior REG person on the project, please get in touch with the REG Programme Lead for the Programme relating to the project. (That person will be at least Senior.)

If the issue cannot be resolved at that level (which does happen from time to time!) then please escalate to the Principal who is the line manager of the Programme lead. See the end of this email for the current Programme Leads and their line managers.
