# Probation information for new joiners and managers

During the initial 6 months in a team member's appointment to the institute, they will undergo probation review with their line manager. (Note that if an existing team member was previously in another role at the Turing and underwent probation review in that role, they do not require a probation review when appointed to a role in REG.) This is designed to integrate with the on-boarding process to ensure that new team members are performing their job as expected. This wiki page outlines the expectations for team members and line managers in going through the probation process.

## Information for team members on probation

Probation in REG is a lightweight review process that will ensure you are settling into the role and performing as expected. Turing policy is that such reviews should occur with meetings at 3 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months from the team member's start date, with a final recommendation at 6 months:

- **3 weeks:** Create a set of initial probation objectives once the team member has settled in. Note that you might not have a clear project or projects to work on at this point, so it is fine to refine any objectives set now at the subsequent reviews. Your manager can help you set appropriate objectives.
- **3 months:** Initial review of progress towards your probation objectives. Your line manager will solicit feedback from people you have worked with to ensure you are settling into the team. You may need to revise your objectives to adjust for changes in the projects you have been working on, which is very normal.
- **5 months:** Final review prior to end of probation. The timing of this review is designed to give one last chance for actionable feedback to someone that is underperforming. In cases where someone is underperforming the most likely action to be taken at this time is to extend probation for an additional 3 months.
- **6 months:** Recommendation is made to pass probation, or to extend if the team member would benefit from additional time to settle into the role.

Upon passing probation, the REG Leadership Team (Director and the Principals) will review your salary to ensure you are fairly placed relative to your peers. See the wiki page on [[Annual-pay-increases]] for more information on the REG philosophy and principles for pay and progression, and additional information specific to the end of probation review below.

## Probation information for line managers

As a manager, you are expected to help guide your report through their initial project work (or other team activities if they are not assigned to a project) and ensure their probation objectives are appropriate for their role. You should be gathering regular feedback from the team member's collaborators (ideally someone more senior than them) and passing on information on their work and giving any constructive feedback. If all is going well, a quick message to the reviewers every few weeks to confirm that all is okay should be fine, and you should pass this information on in your regular 1/1s with the team member.

At 3 months, you will hold a mid-term probation review, which should simply be a slightly more formal version of the ongoing feedback on their performance. If the team member did not have a project initially, then this is a good opportunity to revisit the initial objectives and ensure they reflect the work expected of the team member. This is also a good opportunity to ensure they are participating in team events like Tech Talks, integrating socially with the team (particularly if they are not regularly working in the office), and are contributing to a Service Area.

At 5 months, you will hold a second review. This review is mostly to ensure that any performance issues are communicated well in advance of the 6 month deadline (see below), but should be similar to the 3 month review.

If you do hear any concerns about the team member's performance, it is *very* important to follow up on this promptly. Because REG is a learning team, people are frequently working in unfamiliar territory and it can be difficult to recognize that they can ask for help when they are struggling and it is not a reflection on their performance. The team member could also be facing a difficult situation outside of work -- if they are not comfortable sharing their situation with you, then refer them to Debbie Dixon, the Turing's External Supervisor. If there are problems with the team member's performance and the manager is not comfortable giving this feedback to the team member, then it is best to ask for help from the Principal into whom you report. If there are still problems with the team member's performance at the 5 month review, then you should speak to the Principal in your reporting line.

## Salary review

At the end of probation, REG will conduct a salary review of the team member passing probation. REG has two ways in which salary changes are made: within band changes, and annual progression awards. More information on these types of salary changes can be found on the [[Annual-pay-increases]] wiki page.

A within-band change is to adjust the team member's placement in the band to correct a significant misalignment -- REG makes non-negotiable offers at one of three places in the salary band when hiring new team members, and thus we use the end of probation as the first opportunity to make any corrections we feel are needed to move a team member to a different third of the band. If the manager feels someone is not correctly placed at the end of probation, this recommendation is passed to the REG Leadership team for a decision (the final decision on all salary matters lies with the REG Director, subject to approval by Institute Senior Management).

A manager can assess the placement of their report by determining their report's salary (which is available on Cezanne under "My Team > [Team Member] > Personal & Work Details > Compensation Summary") and comparing to the [[Salary-bands-for-all-REG-Roles]] page. Note that this is inherently a difficult task, as you do not know the placement of the person's peers in the band, so this is considered a recommendation and will be cross-checked by the REG Director (who does have all salary information for the team) for the final decision.

A progression raise is meant to acknowledge the usual development and progression of a team member, and is granted automatically to all team members that are performing well (team members completing probation are considered to be performing well). These awards are given as part of the PRP process, but if the team member is scheduled to end probation after the PRP deadline in December each year, then the team member will not be eligible. Thus, to prevent small differences in start dates from affecting pay rises, the REG Director will recommend an equivalent salary increase at the end of probation to correct for this. This only affects people completing probation between the start of January and the end of June, and the increase will be pro-rated for the amount of service time (i.e. someone ending probation in January will get the equivalent to half of the "usual" progression raise, while someone ending probation at the end of June will get no progression raise, as their raise will be applied in the next PRP round).

Line managers should complete the [probation completion form](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/tree/master/development/probation-completion-form.md) and send to the Principal in their reporting line.
