# 8.3 Exceptions

*Estimated time for this notebook: 15 minutes*


When we learned about testing, we saw that Python complains when things go wrong by raising an "Exception" naming a type of error:





```python
1 / 0
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/q7/nl3w6z854711jwsdy0hj7sxhwypcgh/T/ipykernel_53197/1455669704.py in <module>
    ----> 1 1 / 0
    

    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


Exceptions are objects, forming a [class hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy). We just raised an instance
of the `ZeroDivisionError` class, making the program crash. If we want more
information about where this class fits in the hierarchy, we can use [Python's
`inspect` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html) to get a chain of classes, from `ZeroDivisionError` up to `object`:


```python
import inspect

inspect.getmro(ZeroDivisionError)
```




    (ZeroDivisionError, ArithmeticError, Exception, BaseException, object)





So we can see that a zero division error is a particular kind of Arithmetic Error.





```python
x = 1

for y in x:
    print(y)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/q7/nl3w6z854711jwsdy0hj7sxhwypcgh/T/ipykernel_53197/380152974.py in <module>
          1 x = 1
          2 
    ----> 3 for y in x:
          4     print(y)


    TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable



```python
inspect.getmro(TypeError)
```




    (TypeError, Exception, BaseException, object)



## Create your own Exception

When we were looking at testing, we saw that it is important for code to crash with a meaningful exception type when something is wrong.
We raise an Exception with `raise`. Often, we can look for an appropriate exception from the standard set to raise. 

However, we may want to define our own exceptions. Doing this is as simple as inheriting from Exception (or one of its subclasses):


```python
class MyCustomErrorType(ArithmeticError):
    pass


raise MyCustomErrorType("Problem")
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    MyCustomErrorType                         Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/xv/d5nvn2ps5r3fcf276w707n01qdmpqf/T/ipykernel_48929/4088117092.py in <module>
          3 
          4 
    ----> 5 raise (MyCustomErrorType("Problem"))
    

    MyCustomErrorType: Problem




You can add custom data to your exception:





```python
class MyCustomErrorType(Exception):
    def __init__(self, category=None):
        self.category = category

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Error, category {self.category}"


raise MyCustomErrorType(404)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    MyCustomErrorType                         Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/q7/nl3w6z854711jwsdy0hj7sxhwypcgh/T/ipykernel_53197/1595425230.py in <module>
          7 
          8 
    ----> 9 raise (MyCustomErrorType(404))
    

    MyCustomErrorType: Error, category 404




The real power of exceptions comes, however, not in letting them crash the program, but in letting your program handle them. We say that an exception has been "thrown" and then "caught".





```python
import yaml

try:
    config = yaml.safe_load(open("datasource.yaml"))
    user = config["userid"]
    password = config["password"]

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("No password file found, using anonymous user.")
    user = "anonymous"
    password = None


print(user)
```

    No password file found, using anonymous user.
    anonymous




Note that we specify only the error we expect to happen and want to handle. Sometimes you see code that catches everything:





```python
try:
    config = yaml.safe_lod(open("datasource.yaml"))
    user = config["userid"]
    password = config["password"]
except:
    user = "anonymous"
    password = None

print(user)
```

    anonymous


This can be dangerous and can make it hard to find errors! There was a mistyped function name there ('`safe_lod`'), but we did not notice the error, as the generic except caught it. 
Therefore, we should be specific and catch only the type of error we want.

## Managing multiple exceptions

Let's create two credential files to read


```python
with open("datasource2.yaml", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write("userid: eidle\n")
    outfile.write("password: secret\n")

with open("datasource3.yaml", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write("user: eidle\n")
    outfile.write("password: secret\n")
```

And create a function that reads credentials files and returns the username and password to use.


```python
def read_credentials(source):
    try:
        datasource = open(source)
        config = yaml.safe_load(datasource)
        user = config["userid"]
        password = config["password"]
        datasource.close()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Password file missing")
        user = "anonymous"
        password = None
    except KeyError:
        print("Expected keys not found in file")
        user = "anonymous"
        password = None
    return user, password
```


```python
print(read_credentials("datasource2.yaml"))
```

    ('eidle', 'secret')



```python
print(read_credentials("datasource.yaml"))
```

    Password file missing
    ('anonymous', None)



```python
print(read_credentials("datasource3.yaml"))
```

    Expected keys not found in file
    ('anonymous', None)


This last code has a flaw: the file was successfully opened, the missing key was noticed, but not explicitly closed. It's normally OK, as Python will close the file as soon as it notices there are no longer any references to datasource in memory, after the function exits. But this is not good practice, you should keep a file handle for as short a time as possible.


```python
def read_credentials(source):
    try:
        datasource = open(source)
        config = yaml.safe_load(datasource)

        try:
            print("File loaded, trying to extract credentials")
            user = config["userid"]
            password = config["password"]
        except KeyError:
            print("Expected keys not found in file")
            user = "anonymous"
            password = None
        finally:
            # Runs irrespective of whether keys found
            print("Closing file")
            datasource.close()

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Password file missing")
        user = "anonymous"
        password = None

    return user, password
```

The `finally` clause is executed whether or not an exception occurs.

The last optional clause of a `try` statement, an `else` clause is called only if an exception is NOT raised. It can be a better place than the `try` clause to put code other than that which you expect to raise the error, and which you do not want to be executed if the error is raised. It is executed in the same circumstances as code put in the end of the `try` block, the only difference is that errors raised during the `else` clause are not caught.


```python
def read_credentials(source):
    try:
        datasource = open(source)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Password file missing")
        user = "anonymous"
        password = None

    else:
        # Runs only if opening the file was successful
        config = yaml.safe_load(datasource)
        try:
            print("File loaded, trying to extract credentials")
            user = config["userid"]
            password = config["password"]
        except KeyError:
            print("Expected keys not found in file")
            user = "anonymous"
            password = None
        finally:
            # Runs irrespective of whether keys found
            print("Closing file")
            datasource.close()

    return user, password
```

Don't worry if `else` seems useless to you; most languages' implementations of try/except don't support such a clause. An alternative way of avoiding leaving the file open in the original implementation (and without using `else` or `finally`) is to use a context manager:


```python
def read_credentials(source):
    try:
        with open(source) as datasource:  # closes the file when done
            config = yaml.safe_load(datasource)
        user = config["userid"]
        password = config["password"]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Password file missing")
        user = "anonymous"
        password = None
    except KeyError:
        print("Expected keys not found in file")
        user = "anonymous"
        password = None
    return user, password
```

## Catching Exceptions Elsewhere

Exceptions do not have to be caught close to the part of the program calling
them. They can be caught anywhere "above" the calling point in
the call stack: control can jump arbitrarily far in the program: up to the `except` clause of the "highest" containing try statement.





```python
def f4(x):
    if x == 0:
        return
    if x == 1:
        raise ArithmeticError()
    if x == 2:
        raise SyntaxError()
    if x == 3:
        raise TypeError()
```


```python
def f3(x):
    try:
        print("F3Before")
        f4(x)
        print("F3After")
    except ArithmeticError:
        print("F3Except (ðŸ’£)")
```


```python
def f2(x):
    try:
        print("F2Before")
        f3(x)
        print("F2After")
    except SyntaxError:
        print("F2Except (ðŸ’£)")
```


```python
def f1(x):
    try:
        print("F1Before")
        f2(x)
        print("F1After")
    except TypeError:
        print("F1Except (ðŸ’£)")
```


```python
f1(0)
```

    F1Before
    F2Before
    F3Before
    F3After
    F2After
    F1After



```python
f1(1)
```

    F1Before
    F2Before
    F3Before
    F3Except (ðŸ’£)
    F2After
    F1After



```python
f1(2)
```

    F1Before
    F2Before
    F3Before
    F2Except (ðŸ’£)
    F1After



```python
f1(3)
```

    F1Before
    F2Before
    F3Before
    F1Except (ðŸ’£)


## Design with Exceptions


Now we know how exceptions work, we need to think about the design implications... How best to use them.

Traditional software design theory will tell you that they should only be used
to describe and recover from **exceptional** conditions: things going wrong.
Normal program flow shouldn't use them.

Python's designers take a different view: use of exceptions in normal flow is
considered OK. For example, all iterators raise a `StopIteration` exception to
indicate the iteration is complete.

A commonly recommended Python design pattern is to use exceptions to determine
whether an object implements a protocol (concept/interface), rather than testing
on type.

For example, we might want a function which can be supplied *either* a data
series *or* a path to a location on disk where data can be found. We can
examine the type of the supplied content:


```python
import yaml


def analysis(source):
    if type(source) == dict:
        name = source["modelname"]
    else:
        content = open(source)
        source = yaml.safe_load(content)
        name = source["modelname"]
    print(name)
```


```python
analysis({"modelname": "Super"})
```

    Super



```python
with open("example.yaml", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write("modelname: brilliant\n")
```


```python
analysis("example.yaml")
```

    brilliant





However, we can also use the try-it-and-handle-exceptions approach to this. 





```python
def analysis(source):
    try:
        name = source["modelname"]
    except TypeError:
        content = open(source)
        source = yaml.safe_load(content)
        name = source["modelname"]
    print(name)


analysis("example.yaml")
```

    brilliant


This approach is more extensible, and **behaves properly if we give it some
other data-source which responds like a dictionary or string.**


```python
def analysis(source):
    try:
        name = source["modelname"]
    except TypeError:
        # Source was not a dictionary-like object
        # Maybe it is a file path
        try:
            content = open(source)
            source = yaml.safe_load(content)
            name = source["modelname"]
        except IOError:
            # Maybe it was already raw YAML content
            source = yaml.safe_load(source)
            name = source["modelname"]
    print(name)


analysis("modelname: Amazing")
```

    Amazing


## Re-Raising Exceptions

Sometimes we want to catch an error, partially handle it, perhaps add some
extra data to the exception, and then re-raise to be caught again further up
the call stack. 

The keyword "`raise`" with no argument in an `except:` clause will cause the
caught error to be re-thrown. Doing this is the only circumstance where it is
safe to do `except:` without catching a specific type of error.


```python
try:
    # Something
    pass
except:
    # Do this code here if anything goes wrong
    raise
```

If you want to be more explicit about where the error came from, you can use the `raise from` syntax, which will create a chain of exceptions:


```python
def lower_function():
    raise ValueError("Error in lower function!")


def higher_function():
    try:
        lower_function()
    except ValueError as e:
        raise RuntimeError("Error in higher function!") from e


higher_function()
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/q7/nl3w6z854711jwsdy0hj7sxhwypcgh/T/ipykernel_53197/1206802253.py in higher_function()
          6     try:
    ----> 7         lower_function()
          8     except ValueError as e:


    /var/folders/q7/nl3w6z854711jwsdy0hj7sxhwypcgh/T/ipykernel_53197/1206802253.py in lower_function()
          1 def lower_function():
    ----> 2     raise ValueError("Error in lower function!")
          3 


    ValueError: Error in lower function!

    
    The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:


    RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/q7/nl3w6z854711jwsdy0hj7sxhwypcgh/T/ipykernel_53197/1206802253.py in <module>
         10 
         11 
    ---> 12 higher_function()
    

    /var/folders/q7/nl3w6z854711jwsdy0hj7sxhwypcgh/T/ipykernel_53197/1206802253.py in higher_function()
          7         lower_function()
          8     except ValueError as e:
    ----> 9         raise RuntimeError("Error in higher function!") from e
         10 
         11 


    RuntimeError: Error in higher function!




It can be useful to catch and re-throw an error as you go up the chain, doing any clean-up needed for each layer of a program.

The error will finally be caught and not re-thrown only at a higher program
layer that knows how to recover. This is known as the "throw low catch high"
principle.
