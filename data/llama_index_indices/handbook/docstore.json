However, as you may have noticed, at the bottom of each page is a link to edit the page in the GitHub web editor if you would prefer. This may be easy for making small changes. Pages Each page is a Markdown file with YAML front matter followed by the page contents in Markdown. Front Matter The front matter is used to define various pieces of metadata related to a page. The front matter appears at the top of a content file. In the handbook we format front matter as YAML, preceded and followed by three hyphens. --- title : \"Example Page\"\nweight : 1\n--- The full YAML specification is long and comprehensive. The most important thing to understand here is that the front matter YAML consists of keys and values separated by a hyphen. For example, in the expression weight: 1 , weight is the key with a value of 1 . If you created a page using hugo new then some boilerplate front matter with explanatory comments should already be present. If you are editing an existing page there should already be front matter. Most of the time, the only keys you will need to consider are title and weight . title The title of a page as it appears in the navigation menu weight Determines the order of pages in the navigation menu. Smaller numbers appear first The Hugo documentation details a set of predefined front matter keys . Other valid fields related to the handbook theme are documented in the theme\u2019s README .

When acting as a reviewer, you should see your position as sharing your knowledge and working with the contributors to achieve the best possible result. Reviewing should not be an adversarial process. Recognising Contributions When reviewing a pull request you should try to make sure everyone\u2019s work is recognised. See the Recognising Contributions page for how to do this. Code Quality As a reviewer, one of your jobs is to ensure the quality of the codebase remains high. The CI process will help to assess pull requests by subjecting each commit to a series of tests. Some tests are required to pass and will block merging until they do. Other tests are allowed to fail. This is because these tests check external hyperlinks which can fail for reasons out of our control. For example, a website being offline or a rate limiting API. However, you should always aim to have all tests passing and investigate why any test fails. In particular, a genuinely incorrect link should not be ignored. You should always clone the branch, build the handbook locally (using hugo server --minify ) and inspect the changes using your browser. Not all bugs will be caught by CI and not all changes will be obvious in the source files. Reviewing the Pull Request Use the GitHub review system\nto check the diffs of all source files. You should make use of line comments\nwhere you have comments or questions about particular lines of sections. This gives context so that everyone knows where the problem is or what the question refers to. Line comments can also be used to suggest changes (using the \u00b1 button). You should do this when you have a simple solution. This is an excellent way to share knowledge. When you are finished, submit your review\nmaking sure to choose \u201ccomment\u201d, \u201capprove\u201d or \u201crequest changes\u201d as appropriate. Changes If you request changes, the pull request will enter an iterative process where the contributors make adjustments you repeat the review process. The contributors may accept your proposed changes, make their own changes or push back against changes. All of these may be appropriate. It is important to work together with the contributors to resolve any conversations. All conversations must be resolved before merging.

Hugo automatically gives pages a URL based on the organisation of files in the content/ directory. In Hugo, the first directory after content/ is significant and defines the content type . All handbook pages should be nested in the content/docs/ directory. Sections may be created in content/docs/ (to any depth) by creating a directory containing a content file called _index.md . It is important that the index file exists for Hugo to correctly assign pages to sections and for the theme to arrange pages in the tree-like menu. Creating a New Page To create a new handbook page use the hugo new command. hugo new content/docs/<path/to/page>.md If you wanted to create this page, you would type hugo new content/docs/contributing/creating_a_page.md Hugo will create a new Markdown document at the path you specified. Hugo provides a convenient way to generate new pages from templates called Archetypes . You can see the archetypes in the archetypes/ directory\n. Because your document is in the docs directory, Hugo will look for an archetype called docs.md\nto use as a template. Now you can edit your page with your favourite text editor. For example vim content/docs/contributing/creating_a_page.md Creating a Section We can also use the hugo new command to create a new section, both the directory and index file. For example hugo new content/docs/new_section/_index.md vim content/docs/new_section/_index.md If you only want a section to organise some pages and not to have a page of its own, you can simply leave the content section of _index.md (after the YAML front matter) empty.

This page explains the process of pushing your changes back to the remote, and how your contribution will be checked in the CI and review process. The handbook users the GitHub flow workflow. In short create a branch make changes open pull request review merge to main This workflow should help changes be deployed quickly. When making commits, it is a good idea to follow Tim Pope\u2019s recommendations\nfor good commit messages. Creating a Branch You should make your changes on a new branch, and not on main . This will make it easier to merge changes from many contributors. Try to pick a branch name which is short and describes the change you are making. The changes on one branch or pull request should address a single issue and be self-contained. Don\u2019t try to solve more than one unrelated problem at once. Sticking to this practice will help ensure pull requests are small and easy to review. Otherwise, you might end up having to make many changes during review, have difficultly keeping your branch up to date or upset the reviewers. Opening a Pull Request When you think your changes are ready to be merged, open a pull request. If you don\u2019t want your changes to be merged yet but would like some feedback, you can open a draft pull request. When you open a pull request you will be presented with a template. Complete the sections and answer the questions as best you can. In particular, make sure to reference any issues your work closes or is related to. Continuous Integration A series of tests will be automatically conducted on each commit and pull request. The tests are defined in ci.yaml\n. The following tests are required to pass before merging a pull request A Markdown linter A Hugo build There are other test that are not required before merging, although you should aim to pass all tests. Those are A Markdown link checker A HTML proofer (including link checking) on the output of Hugo Keeping Your Branch up to Date The branch protection rules applied to main will prevent merging out-of-date branches. This means if your branch doesn\u2019t include the changes from the HEAD\nof origin/main it won\u2019t be possible to merge it. If your branch isn\u2019t up to date, you can fix it with a merge or rebase. Merging Merging\nthe changes from origin/main is probably the simpler way to get your branch up to date. It will leave the Git history a bit messier which can bother some people. Ensure you have the latest changes on origin/main in your local repository git fetch Merge origin/main into your branch. If your branch was called my_branch you would run git switch my_branch git merge origin/main Git will notify you of any conflicts. If there are conflicts you should fix them before running git merge --continue to commit. After you are done you can push your changes. Rebasing Rebasing your branch on top of origin/main can make conflicts more difficult or confusing to deal with. Ensure you have the latest changes on origin/main in your local repository git fetch Apply your commits on top of origin/main . If your branch was called my_branch you would run git switch my_branch git rebase origin/main If you want to tidy up your commits or messages you might want to use git rebase -i . Git will notify you of any conflicts. If there are conflicts you will need to fix them iteratively, running git rebase --continue to apply each commit. When the rebase is done, you will need to force push your changes as you have rewritten the history of your branch. git push -f Rewriting history is considered impolite on a branch where you are working collaboratively. It can cause problems when the state of a remote changes unexpectedly. The Review Process Currently reviews are not required and pull requests may be merged by anyone with write access once all required CI checks pass. If you like you can enable auto-merge\nso that the merge happens automatically when this is the case. However, if you\u2019d like your changes reviewed you can suggest reviewers when, or after, opening your pull request.

This improves the readability of source files and make diffs clearer. The Semantic Line Breaks specification explains the rules and reasoning. The most important rules are, A semantic line break MUST occur after a sentence, as punctuated by a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?). A semantic line break SHOULD occur after an independent clause as punctuated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), or em dash (\u2014). A semantic line break MAY occur after a dependent clause in order to clarify grammatical structure or satisfy line length constraints.

In order to assign REG team members to projects, we use emojis to vote for the projects that we would be interested in taking part. You should react to all projects on the \u201cFinding people\u201d column, but also on the \u201cAwaiting go/no-go\u201d column. The voting system is as follows: \ud83d\udc4d Would be okay working on this project \ud83d\udc4e Would rather not work on this project \ud83d\ude04 Would really like to work on this project Issues : Each project has an issue following a common template, including a general description of a project and its current status, for example. There are also issues for service areas and other activities/organisational issues for the team. Project Repos All repos in the Turing organisation that REG have worked on should have the hut23 tag. So if you\u2019re looking for something from a previous project searching for these tags may be a good place to start. Additionally, they should have a tag of the format hut23-123 , where 123 is the issue number for that project in the Hut23 repo. Forecast & Wimbledon We use Forecast to track everyone\u2019s allocations to projects. You can see which projects & service areas everyone in the team is currently involved in, as well as what they were allocated to in the past and will be allocated to in the future. \u201c Wimbledon planner \u201d is an online version of a poster we previously had in the office to display the information in Forecast. It\u2019s easier to see allocations for a longer period, and you can click project names to take you directly to the issue describing that project in the Hut23 repo.

Do all this without a big time commitment, both for presenters and attendees. The talks can be on any topic, including but not limited to: A project (including one that hasn\u2019t started yet). A tool or technique you use. Something you\u2019d like help with. Informal talks or discussions without slides or much preparation are encouraged and very welcome! Talk Format Each slot will be 10 minutes with a few minutes after for questions. We will be fairly strict with time to make sure everyone on the agenda gets to present. You can choose whatever format you like (slides, markdown, notebook, freestyle\u2026), but remember that it\u2019s a short slot which lends itself to concise, high-level overviews of a topic. For example, if your talk is on a project you may wish to cover the following: Background: The domain area, context, problem etc. . Goals: What are the aims of the project? Status: What\u2019s been done so far, example results (if any). Tools & Techniques: What you\u2019re using, what you\u2019ve learnt, what you\u2019d like help with.

The meeting record is important as a reference for what happened at the meeting. In particular, any decisions made or actions assigned need to be clearly recorded for future reference. A good record will also be invaluable to anyone who was not able to attend an in person meeting. Meeting Record Template Below is a suggested template for a meeting record document. The template uses Pandoc\nMarkdown .

How To Use Create the meeting record document before the meeting. Use a collaborative text editor like HackMD so that all attendees may edit the document. Circulate the document to allow others to add and agree on agenda items. Distribute the record or store in a location visible to everyone who may need to read it. The template may also be used to avoid a meeting entirely. The document can be completed collaboratively and asynchronously while achieving the same result.

The aim is to check that the documentation is clear, installation is easy etc. Audits should be conducted by people who have not worked on the project. Past experience These comments from running the first round of these in June 2021: Installation is a big barrier for software with complex build requirements. We tried looking at two web app projects (Counterfactual Covid 19 and CROP) and despite Docker images being available we weren\u2019t able to get them to build correctly. We might have had more success if all we needed to do was a pip or CRAN install. First lesson: installation is ALWAYS harder than you think, and we need to get more fresh eyes on build instructions if we want our software to be easily usable. Second Lesson: Not having someone on hand from the project can be a big barrier, as we suspect there may have just been some small tweaks or changes that would fix our problem. One suggestion was to have a mix of unsupervised hacking and more knowledgeable feedback, maybe by having the person working on the project show up an hour in. If we can\u2019t get someone who knows the project well to attend, at least have them available on Slack in case we get stuck. At the very least, we were able to document our issues on the repo, and in at least one case the project was able to make fixes. One suggestion is to encourage \u201cGood First Issue\u201d tags or \u201cHacktoberfest\u201d-type tags that would help people know what simple things could be tackled in a few hours if they succeed in installing the software. I have found that it isn\u2019t always straightforward to come up with such issues (I tried thinking of some for a previous iteration of the activity, but always got stuck when I realized I didn\u2019t have a clue what to do and explaining the problem was hard enough), and in projects that are currently running it isn\u2019t always easy to leave these uncompleted when you have more time to work on a project. One idea was to have a HackMD document, similar to the one that suggests project meetings for new joiners to shadow, that lists all repos with such issues in one place, making it easier to find something fruitful to work on if these audits continue to be spontaneous. An alternative is to make these non-spontaneous and schedule them in advance. We\u2019ve kicked around the thought of scheduling lightning talks for all projects \u2014 perhaps we could better leverage people\u2019s brains if we gave a lightning talk intro on Tuesday and then guided people through installing and hacking on the software the next day? New joiners to projects inevitably spend a bunch of time doing exactly what we were trying to do in these sessions. Can we leverage the time investment of the new joiner by doubling up other team members to do this? Should new joiners to the team be encouraged to do this for a couple of weeks before being assigned to a project? I had a few new joiners on one of the audit sessions, and they said it was a good way to learn more about the team and our projects.

The following document is designed to help: Showcase what is important to us as RSEs Assessing the current status of an existing repo Define clear objectives Determine where to put effort Provide a common framework and language for collaborators Clearly define when the collaboration is done! The framework includes objectives that focus on improving the impact and legacy of the software, expanding communities of practice, and providing a confident codebase for future research. For each project discuss with collaborators which \u201cLevel\u201d in each of the following categories is a MINIMUM aim for defining done. Remember, time is a resource and so consider where efforts should be prioritised. Reach and Robustness Level 01. Internal users : Identify how users already use the tool and its current issues. Level 02. Best practices : Address minimum code best practices with view to robustness and accessibility Level 03. External users : Identify how similar external users could use the tool and current barriers Level 04. Generalise : Identify how the tool could be made general and current barriers to that Level 05. Proof of concept : Demonstrate its use outside its original intended purpose/audience. Functionality Level 01. Standard use : Install the tool, try out a standard use case, write a demo if one doesn\u2019t exist Level 02. Known Limitations : Understand and report. Level 03. Advanced use : Try out normal range but more advanced use cases, with edge cases. Level 04. New features : Identifying features for new functionality. Level 05. Enhancements : Fix functionality bugs and add features. Documentation Level 01. Follow docs : Follow the existing starting point of documentation (no help!) Level 02. What\u2019s missing : Identify what documentation is missing: e.g. installation, optional arguments, licensing, diagrams/screenshots, future work, etc. Level 03. Write docs : Write the documentation in markdown files Level 04. Published : Release the documentation on GitPages etc Level 05. Walkthrough : Write walkthroughs/demos (also gifs or videos) Testing Level 01. Continous Integration Start the automated infrastructure Level 02. Defining Positive/Negative Cases Conversation about what are the expected outcomes/how the tool works Level 03. Automated User Tests End-to-end tests that check expected outcomes from above, black box Level 04. Fine-grain Tests/Unit Tests Focus on critical/pain points, remove brittleness, modularise and reuseable components Level 05. Error Reporting Focus on negative cases, informative error communication for external collaboration Open Release Level 01. Find barriers : Identify minimum criteria that need to be solved before public release e.g. authorship, sensitivity, licensing, publicity, timings Level 02. Solve barriers : Address the minimum criteria and milestone efforts Level 03. Release : Make the repo public. Level 04. Distribute : Release the repo on PiPY or CRAN or equivalent, include DOI Level 05. Publisise : Publish the repo with JOSS, and/or publicly present the work.

If you\u2019re looking to learn something new, get help with a problem, share something cool you\u2019ve been doing, or find out what others in the team are doing, the list below may give an idea of where to look/what to try. If you\u2019d like to organise something the best options are usually to post to Slack and the Hut23 mailing list (see below). Daily Github Hut23 Repo We use GitHub (and a couple of related tools) extensively for tracking projects and other tasks within the team. There is a separate page describing how we use them . Coffee Breaks We have coffee breaks on Gather twice daily. See the Regular Events page for details. If the times aren\u2019t convenient and you fancy a break then try posting on Slack and the chances are that there\u2019ll be others that fancy a break too. Slack Slack is our main tool for informal messaging and announcements (there\u2019s some info on how to join on here ). It\u2019s also a good place to ask for help. Channels of interest include: #hut23 : Our channel for the REG team (ask someone to add you if you don\u2019t have access) #tps : Channel for the tools, practices and systems (TPS) community at the Turing #askaway : Place to ask general questions ( e.g. that don\u2019t fit in a specific channel) #interesting-events , #general , #social , #random : General chat and announcement about what\u2019s happening around the Turing. We use Geekbot , which is a Slack App. We use this in two different ways (both are voluntary): A virtual daily standup: Geekbot asks what you\u2019re planning to do each day, what you\u2019ve achieved and if there is anything you are stuck on. This can be useful for your own planning, but also helps give an overview of the range of other work and skills within the team. Ice breaker-style questions a few times a week. To join in with the use of Geekbot, you will need to first add the Geekbot app to Slack and then join these slack channels #hut23standup and #hut23standup-tasks . Weekly Tech Talks See here . Reading Groups See here . Approximately Monthly REG Team Meetings Roughly once a month we have an all-REG meeting where we welcome new joiners and a few people briefly present news from around REG or the Turing. This is usually followed by a discussion on a topic of interest for the wider team. If you don\u2019t have the calendar invites (new joiners might not initially) ask someone else in the team to forward them to you. Turing Events The main focus of this page is what we do in REG, but there are many things happening around the Turing that REG members are also encouraged to attend, including: Turing Catchups & Town Halls \u2014 Regular meetings open to all staff with updates from around the institute. New starters may not have the calendar invites initially \u2014 ask others in the team to forward the details if you\u2019re unsure. Turing Events - often public talks & workshops. REG Newsletter We have a monthly REG newsletter which is usually sent around about a week before the monthly team meeting. It contains short project updates and other news/updates from around the team and the institute. It comes to the Hut23 mailing list (see above). If you have something you\u2019d like to be included contact the newsletter owner . Hut23 Mailing List You should automatically be added to the Hut23@turing.ac.uk mailing list when you join REG (if not ask your line manager about it). This is often the best way to contact everyone in the team when organising events, or for other news/communication that should be a bit more permanent/formal than Slack and doesn\u2019t fit in an issue in the Hut23 repo.

Less frequently or ad-hoc Data study Groups Data study groups (DSGs) are week-long hack sessions on different projects that happen a few times a year. Participants are drawn from across the Turing and REG people have previously joined both as team members and project PIs. Turing courses and training There are professional and academic training opportunities around the Turing. There\u2019s some info on Mathison . Additionally, REG also runs a yearly research software engineering course . Remote Co-working Occasionally a few REG members get together on Zoom to Gather to do our work (not necessarily to work on the same thing, but to see each other and have a quick chat whilst we\u2019re working). During the COVID lockdowns, we organised these sessions regularly. Now they only occur on an ad-hoc basis. If you\u2019d like to work in this way, feel free to ask on Slack. Some project teams also choose to work in this way. Hack Sessions & REG Collaborative Time If there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to work on collaboratively feel free to organise a hack session (typically these would be longer but less frequent than a reading group, and perhaps more focused on implementing rather than reading). In the past several of us have got together to work on contributions for Hacktoberfest . Repo Audits A few of us plan to get together to help check whether documentation, usage and installation instructions are clear for a project (for example), or to review the code. See this page for more details. Project retrospective - Snark Hunts A \u201cSnark Hunt\u201d is one way in which we\u2019ve previously organised project retrospectives. We\u2019re open to trying other ideas too. Snark hunts are facilitated discussions after a project has finished where the project team, together with others from REG that didn\u2019t work on the project, answer/ask questions relating to the experience of working on it \u2014 what went well, what could have been better etc. . We don\u2019t do it for every project, but they can be a good opportunity to reflect and to get ideas for what we should do differently/do more of in the future. For more info, see here: Snark Hunt concept Snark Hunt template and example questions Previous Snark Hunts Working on Other Projects Working on different projects with different people causes a natural sharing of knowledge around the team. Beyond the usual project allocation process, there may be other ways to get involved with another project for a short time (some of these are speculative and not currently common practice in REG): Rotating between projects: Where a team member has been on a project for a long time, they may wish to change. Team members should ask to rotate to a different project in the next set of project allocations. Gaps between projects: Occasionally there are short gaps between one project finishing and another starting. These can be opportunities to get involved in something different for a while. One example could be to try a project with the ARC team (though I don\u2019t think anyone in REG has done this yet). Projects may also want to get into the habit of creating \u201cHacktoberfest\u201d style issues that newcomers could quickly get up to speed with and get involved if they have a gap in allocations. Shadowing projects: Especially for new starters, we\u2019ve started to encourage the idea of shadowing projects for a short while, to get an idea of how we work.

Below are some useful tools to help you configure your repo (with links to examples). Some of the topics discussed below are not exclusive to Python. As more content is added to the manual they should be separated out into their own pages. Autoformatters / Linters There are many widely used autoformatter and linters for Python, which can be used as standalone tools or call from .pre-commit , continuous integration tools etc. : isort Sorts your import statements correctly. The order isort \u201csorts\u201d imports in the following order: standard library imports ( e.g.  import os ). related third party imports ( e.g.  import pandas ). local application/library specific imports ( e.g.  from .my_python_file import MyClass ). You should put a blank line between each group of imports. the configuration of isort can be specified in a pyproject.toml file, where isort is using the [tool.isort] section. black A highly opinionated code formatter, which enforces control of minutiae details of your code. The configuration of black can be specified in a pyproject.toml file, where black is using the [tool.black] section. flake8 A wrapper for three other tools: PyFlakes \u2014 checks syntax, without checking the style. pycodestyle \u2014 checks compliance with PEP8 Ned Batchelder\u2019s McCabe script \u2014 checks the cyclomatic complexity of code. Configuration can be specified in a .flake8 configuration file in the root directory of your project. It is possible to use all of these in combination. The ARC group have a template repo with suggested configuration files which you can copy/adapt as required. Type Checkers Type checking is optional in Python but is generally recommended. There are several tools which can perform type checking: mypy \u2014 This type-checker has the distinction of including Guido van Rossum in its core development team. pyright \u2014 By Microsoft. pytype \u2014 By Google. Automation (Pre-Commit & Actions) A convenient way to incorporate many of these tools and checks into your workflow is to use pre-commit . Below is an example. You could adapt this to your needs, or create your own from the many hooks described in the documentation . # See https://pre-commit.com for more information\n# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks\nrepos : - repo : https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n rev : v4.2.0\n hooks : - id : trailing-whitespace\n- id : end-of-file-fixer\n- id : check-yaml\n- id : check-xml\n- id : check-json\n- id : pretty-format-json\n args : [-- no - ensure-ascii, --no-sort-keys, --autofix]\n files : \".+json\"\n- id : check-added-large-files\n- repo : https://github.com/psf/black\n rev : 22.3.0\n hooks : - id : black\n#        files: \"*.py\"\n exclude : \".+/ignore_this_legacy_file.py\"\n- repo : https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-autopep8\n rev : 'v1.6.0'  # Use the sha / tag you want to point at\n hooks : - id : autopep8\n- repo : https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy\n rev : 'v0.960'  # Use the sha / tag you want to point at\n hooks : - id : mypy\n exclude : \".+/ignore_this_legacy_file.py\"\n- repo : https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort\n rev : v5.10.1\n hooks : - id : isort\nThis example checks: There is no trailing whitespace at the end of each line.

Any python code is tested for type safeness (That is declaring types is optional, but if types are declared they must be correct). The import statements in any python code are correctly ordered. If any of these tests fail or need to alter any files, the commit will fail. This prevents you from accidentally forgetting to check your changes before you commit them. If you wish to run the checks in pre-commit without attempting to commit your changes: pre-commit run --all-files There are many other possible checks available with pre-commit , which you can incorporate according to the needs of your project. The pre-commit documentation provides much more detail. Testing tools Some suggested testing tools: A test framework pytest or the less fashionable unittest . Coverage reporting pytest-cov (a plugin for pytest ) or coverage . A tool for testing code examples in your documentation doctest .

It is possible to do this so that there are common standards between collaborators in the code base, while allowing for differences in individuals\u2019 configurations. Some of the topics discussed below are heavily focused on python development. In due course we should generalise this to cover other languages. General Some common, particular formatting/encoding options can be configured for a range of editors/IDEs by using EditorConfig in your repo. A .editorconfig needs to be placed in the root of your repo. Many (but not all) editors support EditorConfig files allowing different members of your project team to use their own favourite editor while maintaining common coding standards. Some editors support EditorConfig natively; others require a plugin to support EditorConfig. There is some overlap in functionality between EditorConfig and Flake8. Crudely EditorConfig applies standards to files as they are created/edited, while Flake8 checks all files (irrespective of origin) on demand. Both tools need to be set up en ensure that they are mutually compatible. However, since the configurations for both Flake8 and EditorConfig rarely change after the initial setup of the project, this is not a problem in practice. VS code VS Code Python documentation ARC suggested config (Turing members only) Extensions Focusing on Python only, useful extensions include: Python \u2014 adds core functionality for linting/navigating/debugging/etc. Pylance Jupyter Python Indent \u2014 improves editor behaviour for matching indentation across lines autoDocstring \u2014 auto-generate template docstrings IntelliCode \u2014 improved auto-completion/code suggestions Black formatter (pre-release) \u2014 auto-format code with black isort (pre-release) \u2014 auto-format code with isort Python Type Hint \u2014 helps with completing type-hints The black and isort pre-release packages are currently designed to work with the Python pre-release version. This is likely to be consolidated/improved in the future. Settings VS Code Settings are stored in: Global user settings: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json . Project-specific (Workspace) settings: <PROJECT_ROOT>/.vscode/settings.json . You can also customise most settings via the Code -> Preferences -> Settings menu. For Python specifically note the Extensions -> Python section. Here\u2019s an example config for Python (reliant on installing the extensions above): {  \"python.linting.flake8Enabled\" : true ,  \"python.linting.mypyEnabled\" : true ,  \"python.testing.pytestEnabled\" : true ,  \"python.linting.pylintEnabled\" : true ,  \"autoDocstring.docstringFormat\" : \"numpy\" ,  \"[python]\" : {  \"editor.rulers\" : [ 88 ],  \"editor.defaultFormatter\" : \"ms-python.black-formatter\" ,  \"editor.formatOnSave\" : true ,  \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\" : {  \"source.organizeImports\" : true\n}, }, } It does the following: Activates linting with flake8 , mypy and pylint . We suggest using flake8 at a minimum, but you may not want all three activated as it gets quite noisy and there\u2019s some overlap between them. Sets pytest to be the default test framework. Sets numpy to be the default format for docstrings generated with autoDocstring. Sets black to be the default formatter, and automatically runs black and isort when saving a file. Adds a vertical ruler to the editor at 88 characters (default line length used by black ) for Python files only. Note that: It\u2019s possible to specify arguments for the linters/formatters in settings.json . We suggest using each tool\u2019s own configuration files ( e.g.  .flake8 ), as these will then be picked up by other tools and editors as well.

Selecting the Python Interpreter VSC Python Interpreters Docs For each workspace VS Code can be configured to use a specific Python interpreter (environment). That interpreter is then used by default when doing anything with your code (running scripts, linting, tests etc. ) To set the interpreter: Open a .py file. Click on the details of the currently used environment on the status bar (bottom right). Select an interpreter from the list that appears (or write the path to it). Or from the command palette: Cmd-Shift-P -> Search for \u201cPython: Select Interpreter\u201d. Linting VSC Linting Docs If linters are activated (see Settings) they will be run after saving a file, and any problems the enabled tools encounter will be highlighted in-line in the editor, and be listed in the \u201cProblems\u201d tab of the panel at the bottom (or select View -> Problems from the menu). Hovering over a piece of code with a problem in the editor will give you more details about it, and may have a \u201cQuick Fix\u201d available, which will edit the code for you to fix it. Formatting VSC Formatting Docs VS code can use a few different file formatters (e.g. black , yapf , autopep8 \u2014 we recommend black ), which can be configured to run automatically when saving files (see settings above) or with the following shortcuts: Option-Shift-F. Save the file (if auto-formatting is configured). Right-click in a Python editor -> Format Document. Cmd-Shift-P (Opens Command Palette) -> Search for \u201cformat\u201d -> \u201cFormat Document\u201d. Running Tests VSC Testing Docs If you have enabled pytest (or another framework, e.g. unittest ), tests will be discovered and appear in the Testing menu (lab bottle on the left side menu). From here you can run all/individual tests. You can also search for \u201cTests\u201d in the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P) to find options for running tests. If a test fails, clicking on it will show the error message. You can also debug tests (see debugging). If you have a tests file open in an editor the latest pass/fail status of a test will be shown (or a play button if the test hasn\u2019t run before) \u2014 running tests can be triggered from there too. Debugging VSC Debugging Docs Other Tips and Tricks Auto-import: If you start typing a function name that hasn\u2019t been imported, VS Code will pop up a list of suggested functions and \u201cAuto-Import\u201d them (add an import statement to the top of the script) if you select one of them. Rename symbol: Right-clicking on a (variable/function/class/etc.) name in a file, selecting \u201cRename symbol\u201d, and entering a new name will change the name of all instances of that across your codebase (but respecting the scope of the renamed entity). Jupyter: The Python extension comes with a Jupyter extension so you can run and edit notebooks in VS Code. Personally, I prefer the native Jupyter notebook/lab interface to the VS Code one. AutoDocstring: If the AutoDocstring extension is installed, typing \"\"\" then hitting enter will generate a template docstring for you containing placeholders for all arguments (including their types if type hints are used in the function definition). Go to definition: Right-clicking on a (variable/function/class/etc.) name and selecting \u201cGo to definition\u201d will take you to where that thing is defined in the codebase.

RSE projects There should be a Github issue for each thing we do. It\u2019s ok for issues to evolve and my preference would be that the top description box always has the most up to date, clearest description of the issue and its definition of done. Feel free to make liberal use of the comments for communication and tracking investigative / exploratory work. The main description box should contain a clear definition of done / acceptance criteria sufficient for the following to be done in principle by different people from the team who are involved in the project. Implement the functionality Write tests to validate the implementation meets the definition of done Review the implementation for correctness All code should have automated tests, with all tests runnable by a single command by someone who has checked out a fresh copy of the repo. All dependencies, installation, compilation etc should be scripted such that these can be triggered by a single command by someone who has checked out a fresh copy of the repo. Dependencies required only for testing can require a second command or few. Each new issue should be developed on a short-lived feature branch split from \u201cmain\u201d. These branches ideally only live around 0.5-2 days before being merged back into main. Merge process should be: merge main into feature branch and resolve any conflicts. Push latest feature branch to Github. Open PR to merge into main after review + continuous integration (CI) tests. Code should be committed regularly in small chunks. You should generally be committing multiple times per day. Commits on feature branches can have broken functionality or tests, but all merges into main should only occur at commits where the code is correct and has passing tests. All code commits should be accompanied by tests verifying it behaves as expected. At a minimum code submitted as a PR should have tests that show it meets the definition of done defined in the related issue(s). However, code should have additional unit / regression / integration tests where appropriate (it\u2019s almost always appropriate). Writing code then tests is a significantly lower quality assurance measure than writing tests first / in iteration with the code, so you should do the latter. All code should have had two eyeballs on it before it is merged into main, either through pair programming or code review within the PR. Please note on the PR who two eyes were. The second pair of eyes can be anyone on the project (not just a coder), anyone in our team or someone from a related team (e.g. the UCL research programming). Whether as pair programming or a code review, the final PR code should be validated against the definition of done detailed in the related issue(s) by the two pairs of eyes. The Github repository should be set up to run all tests on all pushes to all branches and on all PRs. Currently this can be done for public repos via GitHub Actions. If CI is set up this way, commits to main should be blocked unless all tests pass.

Introductions Each new starter gets assigned two buddies to be friendly points of contact. The person in charge of onboarding\nshould let you know who these are a bit before you start; If that doesn\u2019t happen, please email them about it. Your buddies will welcome you on the first day. In the first few days there will be a welcome coffee to give you a chance to introduce yourself to the whole REG team, and within the first few weeks you will also have a 1-on-1 meeting with REG\u2019s Director. You will have a week or so before you will be assigned to a project. Please use this time to do admin stuff, set up your laptop and tools, get to know people, read this handbook and our internal wiki, and shadow meetings (see below). Here we go over the main points you should remember to do, but for an attempt at listing all the small tasks that occupy a new starter, please see (and improve!) this checklist . We also have a page of tables available with information about links and resources related to REG and the Alan Turing Institute. Administrivia HR will set up a meeting with you to discuss general information e.g. pay, health, leaves, benefits. IT will also meet you to discuss accounts and Turing wide systems. Both of these will typically take place in the first day or two. We have a dedicated page\nfor various systems REG uses. Have a look at the high priority section on your first day . We also have a Remote Working\npage for Zoom, Teams, and Gather. REG offers new starters the opportunity to shadow meetings across the group to meet people and get a feel for how we work. The shadowing document\nshould be updated with meetings you are free to come and listen in on, if it hasn\u2019t been please bug the person in charge of onboarding . To access the office you will need a British Library pass. To get a British Library pass you will need to go through the background screening check. Hopefully that process will have been completed by the time you start, but if it hasn\u2019t even been started yet (this happens), please talk to HR\nto make sure the process gets going. Once the screening is done, HR should let you know within a few days that your pass is ready. In the meanwhile, you can either enter the British Library through the general public entrance and come talk to the Turing\u2019s reception, or, preferably, arrange for a visitor pass for yourself for the days when you\u2019re coming in. For the first day or two, ask your line manager to take care of this, once you\u2019ve got your Turing account going you can directly ask reception . The password for the \u201cATI Guest\u201d Wi-Fi network can be seen hanging around the office. IT\ncan arrange access to the Eduroam network. Eduroam credentials can be used to access Wi-Fi at many academic institutions. Please also write a short, informal paragraph about your background for to be put into the next REG newsletter, and send it to the newsletter owner . Overview of How REG Operates Work at REG revolves around projects and service areas. You will typically be assigned to two different projects at any time, with at least one other REG person and usually some external collaborators. You may want to browse REG\u2019s portfolio of projects in the project tracker\nto get an idea of what we\u2019re up to. The project tracker is also used for expressing preferences on which upcoming projects you would like to work on, but you don\u2019t have to worry about that for first few weeks. We very much encourage REG members to learn new things, so feel free to choose projects that sound interesting to you even if they are unfamiliar.

This, too, is something you don\u2019t have to think about for now, but come back to it once you\u2019ve settled into your workflow with a project. REG also gives its members some time, known as 22 days time, to work on side projects they find interesting. Your line manager can give you the details on this. If you like, you can see our team reporting structure . Note, however, that we do not have a hierarchical culture, and line managing relations are not about assigning work to people. Your work tasks will be coordinated with the people in your projects. You should talk to your line manager about things such as How project allocation works, and what kinds of projects you would like to work on Managing your time and growth How we work (practices, tools, languages, etc. ) How you would like to grow and develop in your role and what opportunities exist to support that.

They will find something meaningful for you to do which might be something like: Browse the Project tracker and emoji any projects in the Finding people and Awaiting go/no-go columns. Note: you will be notified to do this before being assigned to a project. Browse the Service areas list , discuss the different areas with people involved and emoji those that are looking for people. Work on a Turing Data Story. There\u2019s always a story to join or a new one to start. You can then keep working on it on your 22 days time once allocated to a project. This option has been very popular. Tackle a GitHub issue marked with the good first issue tag in a repo that REG works on. Whenever a new starter is looking for things to do, the person in charge of onboarding will send a message on Slack asking everyone to tag suitable issues. Work on a REG-internal project that is easy to rotate in/out of. Any ad hoc ideas that come up. Maybe you found a project that really interests you and want to help, or maybe there\u2019s some team organisational thing that comes up that you volunteer for.

Rather they are a reference to help with your setup. If they are wrong or incomplete, please edit them. The page has been roughly organised into high priority things (do in your first couple of days), low priority (sometimes in the first couple of weeks), and reference. If any of the material is unfamiliar ( e.g. you haven\u2019t seen a GitHub project board before), then please ask your buddies (or anyone else you meet in the group) to have an informal chat about it. High priority Getting a computer Receive (or be assigned) new computer from IT. It will have an admin account for IT, and probably an account for you with a default password. Log in with the password provided by IT. Change your password. Your new password should be strong (12 random characters), and ideally randomly generated by a password manager. Feel free to use a diceware-style passphrase. Your password should be: unique to the machine/system randomly generated (use a password generator) have an entropy of at least 64 bits, see wikipedia At least 11 characters if alphanumeric (use 12, though) At least 10 characters if alphanumeric plus symbols At least 5 words if using dice ware At this point you can also configure fingerprint authentication. Make sure you have FileVault on. You should be setup with local admin privileges. Contact IT if this isn\u2019t the case. Install Homebrew We recommend using Homebrew as your Mac package manager. Currently IT installs Homebrew by default on our laptops under /usr/local/bin . However, in the long run this might create problems with the new M1 Macs we use. To see if this problem applies to you, run which brew in the terminal and check if that\u2019s the location. Until this is fixed by IT, what we recommend is the following: Uninstall the current version of Homebrew by running the following command in the terminal: sudo /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall.sh)\" Install Homebrew again following the instructions on the website . This will install Homebrew under /opt/homebrew/bin/brew (you can check by entering which brew in the terminal to see the new location). Communication Channels Most communication happens through Slack. More structured communication happens through GitHub. These two systems are the first things you should setup (once you\u2019re on Slack it\u2019s a lot easier to ask for help). Slack Install Slack: brew install --cask slack Once installed join the Turing Slack . You can self-subscribe with your @turing.ac.uk email address. Important channels to join: You should be added to #general and #random by default. Ask anyone in the team to add you to the private channel #hut23 . If you are a senior, please ask another senior to invite you to the REG senior\u2019s Slack channel ( #line-managers ). GitHub We use GitHub for most coordination. To get access to the Turing GitHub , create a GitHub account (or use an existing one), then fill this form on Turing Complete with your GitHub handle (if you have access to Turing Complete). Then let the GitHub org controller know that you have done this and they can add you straight away. Also check the Project tracker to get a feeling on what goes on. We use it to track official projects we are tasked with. This is where we express preferences for projects, with emojis. Project leads should be assigned to the relevant issue and are responsible for keeping the issue up to date. Check this section of the handbook for more details. Office 365 account Your Turing main account rests here . You get access to mail (Exchange), calendar, a shared drive, Office apps. Check that you can login, and change your password and configure MFA. Ask IT if in need for help.

If you get interested in something just ask if there is a channel about it. All of the REG-specific channels are prefixed with hut23 , so that\u2019s a good thing to search for in the channel list. You may also want to add yourself to #hut23standup , which some of us use for automated standups of \u201cAbout Us\u201d questions. The purpose is to get to know other team members by answering a question three times a week. Geekbot should send you the next question at 10:30am on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Tips for using Geekbot: You can report before/after Geekbot asks you by sending it a message from Slack, e.g. report About Us . The Slack channels containing the responses can generate a lot of notifications. You might want to turn off notifications, or alternatively mute the channel and check in on it manually instead. (Right-click on the channel name to do this.) You can customise the time of Geekbot\u2019s questions. Send dashboard as a message to Geekbot and click the link it returns. From there, you can select a standup and the \u201cMy preferences\u201d button will take you to the customisation page. (This setting may not be enabled on all standups.) You can export a list of your previous responses to a standup from the dashboard. Click on the \u201ctimeline\u201d tab of the relevant standup, and from there you can select the participants and questions to export to a csv file. This is particularly useful when you have forgotten to fill in Harvest for a while and need the information from the daily standup! Other workspaces you could join: The Society of Research Software Engineering has a Slack worspace . For information about joining the Society see the SocRSE page . Mailing Lists The Newsletters & Mailings page on Turing Complete has a \u201cUpdate Mailing Preferences\u201d link to sign up to receive some internal newsletters/communication. Harvest and Forecast We use Harvest to (loosely) track our time, and Forecast to manage allocations to projects. Get in touch with the person in charge of researcher tool management to setup a meeting sometime in your first week. Harvest is a time tracking app used to monitor the amount of time being dedicated to each project. The easiest way to get set up is to ask your Line Manager or another member of the team to invite you and make you admin. You can then add yourself as a team member to whichever projects you\u2019re working on and start tracking your time. There is a page here which goes into more detail about where you should log different activities. Cezanne HR Our HR system is Cezanne HR . You can log onto this with your Turing credentials using the \u201cEnterprise login\u201d option. If \u201cEnterprise login\u201d does not work, email HR to fix it. This system is used for: Requesting annual leave. Recording days off due to illness etc. . Managing the objective setting and performance review process (after your probation period). Create a Public Profile on the Turing Website There are several ways to do this: You can fill in this form on Turing Complete to request a public profile. Alternatively, contact the people in charge of REG communications , providing the following info: Your title and full name A short personal bio A brief description of your Turing-related research (optional) A brief description of your achievements and award (optional) Photo (optional) Webpage You can also edit the website yourself directly. To do so, you must complete a round of online training , after which you will be granted edit permissions.

The Turing is not on their list, but you can still use it. You will need proof of employment - a screenshot of Cezanne or the top of your Turing contract (including start date) have worked for people in the past. Once GitHub have approved your Pro account, go to the JetBrains website and create an account there (sign in via GitHub) You can now apply for a free educational licence (\u201cApply for a free student or teacher license\u201d) for professional versions of various IDEs.

A few things still need to be done on the old intranet, Turing Complete . Gray Dawes Gray Dawes is the Turing\u2019s system for booking travel and accommodation. Instructions on how to get set up can be found on Mathison . When making bookings on Gray Dawes, you will have to additionally submit an Excel approval form (available at the right-hand sidebar of the same Mathison page). This form should be filled in and sent to the Principal you have a direct link to in the line management chain for approval. Certify Other work-related expenses can be reimbursed via Certify: see the Mathison page for more information on how to get set up. Briefly, you will have to fill in a Travel and Expenses Policy Compliance Form and email it to Finance. On this form, the \u2018approver\u2019 should be the REG Director. The REG Wiki contains more information on the reimbursement process, including information about the specific department and project codes you should be using. When you get access to Certify, it\u2019s a good idea to check that you\u2019ve been set up with the correct codes. If you applied for a visa to work at the Turing, you are also allowed to claim up to \u00a34000 back. More details on this can be found in Mathison as well as the REG Wiki .

To help with this every new employee should be assigned buddies. The buddies are responsible for providing informal friendly faces to offer advice, guidance, and encouragement on any aspect of working within REG and ARC. We also emphasise that the buddies should be a safe space where new-starters can get help with any technical questions that they feel is silly or trivially easy and may not feel comfortable admitting to the wider group. The Process Before the new starter starts at the Turing they should be assigned two buddies from our buddy pool . If possible, the buddies should not be assigned to the projects on which the new starter is likely to work, and ideally at a similarly seniority to the new starter. We would also like for each new starter to have a third buddy from some other team. We think that in a remote & hybrid setting it will help new-starters meet people and get a feel for the wider Turing ecosystem. This has been trialed in a few instances, to positive feedback, but to make this be standard practice we would need it to be more bidirectional, with REGers volunteering to buddy with people outside of REG. The new-starter should be made aware of the buddies\u2019 role before they start, and meeting their buddies should typically be the first appointment on their first day. The buddy system in managed by the person in charge of onboarding . Buddy Guidelines Have a coffee with the new employee on their first day. If needed, introduce them to the team at welcome coffee. Be as informal as possible, make the new starter feel welcome and comfortable. Make sure the new starter is familiar with the New Starter page . Check for sticking points. Meet the new starter where they are at. Make it clear that the new employee can get in touch any time for questions and concerns, regardless of triviality. Emphasise that you\u2019re also there for technical pointers. This is to encourage the new-starter to be comfortable asking for help when they are stuck and hopefully lessening imposter syndrome anxiety. Have a check-in chat with the new starter at least once in the first couple of weeks, and again a few weeks after. During these check-ins, uncover pain points and concerns. Help socialise the new employee to the group\u2019s culture and processes. Be open, honest, and respect confidentiality. If needed, help make introductions. Tips for Buddies Don\u2019t worry about being perceived as the expert. Focus your attention on the new employee. Be patient: It takes time to develop a relationship. Don\u2019t try to cover everything right away. Be positive: New employees will grow into their roles if given proper reinforcement. Don\u2019t try to force a relationship. New employees will vary in how much they turn to a buddy. Try to identify the new employee\u2019s personality and communication style and adapt accordingly. Don\u2019t be judgemental. Simply offer feedback. Maintain a good attitude and a teaching spirit. How to be a Buddy Being a buddy can be a rewarding process. You will help avoid new starters feeling at sea and reaffirm their decision to join the group. To sign up please add your name to our buddy pool .
