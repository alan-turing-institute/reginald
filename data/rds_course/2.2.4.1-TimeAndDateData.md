# 2.2.4.1 Time and Date Data

Dealing with time and date data can be tricky. String-formatted data is
hard to compare and represent for modelling.



```python
print("02/03/1900" > "01/01/2020")
```

    True



We use the `datetime.datetime` object in examples below. However, you
can also use `datetime.date` and `datetime.time` as appropriate.

## datetime

We need to represent date data in a format that will allow us to compare
items and perform operations such as addition and subtraction.

Pythonâ€™s standard library includes the
[`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module.
This allows us to represent dates and times as structured objects.



```python
import datetime

# create a datetime object with value set to now 
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(now)
```

    2022-09-26 11:56:14.348543



This object has structure. We can, for example, extract the year
property from this object.



```python
print(now.year)
```

    2022



We can also compare this datetime to others, as well as perform date
arithmetic.



```python
past = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat("2020-12-22") 
is_gt_now = past > now
print(f"d gt now: {is_gt_now}")

# subtract past from now
difference = now - past 
print(f"now - d: {difference}. Type: {type(difference)}")
```

    d gt now: False
    now - d: 643 days, 11:56:14.348543. Type: <class 'datetime.timedelta'>



We can get a numeric, [POSIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), representation of these dates with `datetime.datetime.timestamp()`.



```python
print(f"now timestamp: {now.timestamp()}")
print(f"past timestamp: {past.timestamp()}")
```

    now timestamp: 1664189774.348543
    past timestamp: 1608595200.0



Note some UTC vs local time complications detailed
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.timestamp).

## Converting From/To String

For converting *from* a string, we can use the
`datetime.datetime.strptime(date_string, format)` function. Format codes
are detailed
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes).



```python
dt = datetime.datetime.strptime("30/03/99 16:30", "%d/%m/%y %H:%M")
print(f"{dt}. Type: {type(dt)}")
```

    1999-03-30 16:30:00. Type: <class 'datetime.datetime'>



And to convert a date *to* string we can use
`datetime.datetime.strftime(format)`.



```python
s = now.strftime("%d/%m/%y %H:%M") 
print(f"{s}. Type: {type(s)}")
```

    26/09/22 11:56. Type: <class 'str'>



## Pandas Datetime Accessor (`Series.dt`)

Pandas provides an accessor object for datetime-like properties of
Series values. See
[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.html).

E.g. (taken almost directly from Pandas docs, linked above)



```python
import pandas as pd

seconds_series = pd.Series(pd.date_range("2000-01-01", periods=3, freq="s"))
display(seconds_series)

# access seconds property of values in series
display(seconds_series.dt.second)
```
