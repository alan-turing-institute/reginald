# Overtime

REG operates with two principles that inform our overtime practices:
* We truly work our contractually agreed number of hours, unlike e.g. many academics, who often work more on a "as much as needed" basis,
* Our hours are flexible as long as you are available for meetings when necessary during normal office hours.

This leads to the following practices:
1. If on some days or weeks you need to work more than your usual hours you should try to recover these hours back within a week or two. As long as you're able to do this, and the total number of hours is below one working day's worth, it's fine and you can do it on your own without manager approval or formal time tracking.
2. If you find that you're frequently working more than your usual hours and struggle to recover those hours back within a week or two, you are overworking. You must talk to your line manager about your workload and how it should be changed.
3. If you anticipate in advance needing to work more than your usual hours due to some specific, temporary work package that goes beyond the flexibility of point 1. in this list , talk to your line manager about a formal Time Off In Lieu (TOIL) arrangement to make sure you recover those hours later.

Note that sticking to your hours, avoiding overworking, and in general keeping a healthy work-life balance can be especially hard when working remotely.
We trust people to organise their own schedules, but encourage everyone in the team to keep a clear separation between free time and work time, and to really switch off from Slack, email, and such when not working.
