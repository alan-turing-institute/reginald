A regular series of open invitation talks from leading voices in data science, AI, healthcare and those with lived experience dealing with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) organised by the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility. Open to everyone across the AIM programme and the broader multiple long-term conditions research community, these talks are designed to share knowledge and stimulate discussion regarding AI and MLTC research.
 
Many people suffer from multiple health conditions, yet most of the evidence base for medical care centres on the treatment of single conditions; surprisingly little is known about identifying and treating multiple long-term conditions. To address this emerging strategic priority for the UK’s National Health Service and research funders, at least £23 million has been directed into the AIM Programme to establish research to better understand and treat MLTCs.
A dedicated Research Support Facility (RSF) has been established to support and facilitate activity across the independently-funded AIM research consortia. Hosted by The Alan Turing Institute in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh and Swansea University, the RSF are holding a series of monthly sessions with thought leaders and subject-matter experts – including experts by lived experience - on the second Tuesday of each month.
Funded by NIHR, a dedicated Research Support Facility (RSF) has been established to support and facilitate activity across the independently-funded AIM research consortia.
Every RSF talk takes place online and is recorded and archived on YouTube. Watch the recordings below.
