Yacine Jernite is a researcher at Hugging Face working on exploring the social and legal context of Machine Learning systems, particularly ML and NLP datasets. He has worked on several aspects of data curation, documentation, and governance, and has most recently been coordinating data and multidisciplinary research efforts within the BigScience workshop on Large Language Models. Before joining Hugging Face, Yacine obtained a Ph.D. from New York University working on language modeling and medical applications of machine learning from 2012 to 2018, followed by a postdoc at FAIR NY (Meta AI) working on automatic summarization and abstractive question answering from 2018  to 2020.
