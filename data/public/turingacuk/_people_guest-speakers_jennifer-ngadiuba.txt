Dr. Jennifer Ngadiuba is Associate Scientist with Wilson Fellowship at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the leading facility for particle physics research in the United States. She is specialised in the application of AI to particle physics towards more intelligent detector systems, data reduction and data analysis strategies. This ensures the efficient extraction of the most fundamental physics information from the multitude of data collected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s highest-energy particle physics experiment located at the CERN laboratory (Switzerland-France).
Jennifer co-founded the fast machine learning organisation, a research collective of physicists, engineers and computer scientists interested in deploying machine learning algorithms for unique and challenging scientific applications. Dr. Ngadiuba is also applying modern anomaly detection techniques to advance the quest for elusive new physics at the LHC.
