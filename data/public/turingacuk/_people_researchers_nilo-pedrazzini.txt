Nilo is a Research Associate in corpus-based digital humanities within the Living with Machines project. He holds a BA in Russian and English from the University of Pavia (Italy) and an MSt in Slavonic Studies (Serbian and early Slavic) from the University of Oxford, where he is currently undertaking his DPhil in Linguistics. He specialises in corpus linguistics and the syntax-semantics interface, focussing on the computational modelling and statistical analysis of historical languages.
He has taught general linguistics at the University of Oxford and digital humanities at King’s College London, and he is currently a Fellow at RROx, the Oxford network of the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN). 
At the Turing, Nilo mainly works on the development of methods for querying large historical corpora at scale and tracking changes in linguistic phenomena.
Nilo is particularly interested in the adaptation of research methods from outside the humanities to humanities research, and in exploring how historical data can help our understanding of real-world issues.
