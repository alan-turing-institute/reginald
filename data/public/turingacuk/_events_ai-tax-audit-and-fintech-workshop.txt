The use of digital technologies in tax and financial services has come far over the last ten years while there has been little attention on how it empowers and impacts a diverse society. The workshop aims to match digital innovation in tax administration with principles and mechanisms to protect both users and the reliability of outputs.
The workshop will bring together experts in tax administration, fintech, economic policy design, machine learning, AI, early career researchers and PhD students. It is co-organized by Queen Mary University of London (Centre for Commercial Law Studies, Institute of Tax Law), University of Exeter (Tax Administration Research Centre (TARC)) and the University of Surrey (Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence, Surrey Law and Technology Hub, Sustainable and Explainable Fintech Centre, Surrey Business School).
