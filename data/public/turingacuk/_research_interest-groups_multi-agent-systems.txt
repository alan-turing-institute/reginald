Multi-agent systems (MAS) are a core area of research of contemporary artificial intelligence. A multi-agent system consists of multiple decision-making agents which interact in a shared environment to achieve common or conflicting goals. MAS research spans a range of technical problems, such as how to design MAS to incentivise certain behaviours in agents, how to design algorithms enabling one or more agents to achieve specified goals in a MAS, how information is communicated and propagated among agents, and how norms, conventions and roles may emerge in MAS. A vast array of applications can be addressed using MAS methodologies, including autonomous driving, multi-robot factories, automated trading, commercial games, automated tutoring, etc.
The MAS interest group at The Alan Turing Institute provides a central meeting point for UK-based researchers in universities, industry, and defence who are interested in MAS research. We maintain a UK-wide MAS mailing list through which list members can communicate relevant opportunities and events. We organise regular events (spotlight presentations, UK-MAS symposia) and maintain a virtual MAS labs map shown below.
 
 
Watch interest group organisers Stefano Albrecht and Michael Wooldridge discuss MAS work in more detail in the below videos.


The principle activities of the MAS group are the following:


The group organises a Multi-Agent Systems Talk Series which takes place once a month to give UK-based labs an opportunity to present their MAS research and initiatives. Sign up to our mailing list to receive updates about upcoming talks. If you would like to give a talk, please contact the organisers.

The new Special Issue on Multi-Agent Systems Research in the United Kingdom has now been published in the AI Communications journal. This volume contains 14 contributed articles from UK-based labs, detailing their research in multi-agent systems, developed methods, and open problems.Read the guest editorial, and access the full edition here.
The original call for contributions can be found here.
Is human intelligence inherently social?
Will AI require analogues of human social skills, such as cooperation, coordination, and negotiation?
Should machines use human languages to communicate with each other?
How do norms and languages emerge?
How can an autonomous agent interact safely and reliably with other agents and humans to achieve its goals?
How can research in multi-agent systems effectively translate into industry?
