This event will bring together leading researchers from Canada, the UK, and France to explore the technical underpinnings of topics including AI fairness, interpretability and privacy, as well as policy issues including online harms.
The workshop will aim to establish closer links between the research communities in the three countries and forge new collaborative projects. While we intend to focus on technical work, of course it’s vital to connect this to the real world.
We are very pleased also to be hosting sessions with legal and policy experts from each of the countries who will compare the regulatory and policy environments in each jurisdiction.
A detailed agenda will be shared shortly. The programme will comprise keynote presentations and lightning talks, as well as breakout sessions. We hope to explore collaborative projects in detail during the breakout sessions.
Please note that this working meeting is for an advanced professional audience and places are limited. We are seeking delegates from a range of disciplines working on themes relevant to AI & Society such as algorithmic fairness, interpretability, privacy or on policy issues such as online harms, either in academia or industry, with an affiliation to an academic institution, government organisation or sector relevant company.
