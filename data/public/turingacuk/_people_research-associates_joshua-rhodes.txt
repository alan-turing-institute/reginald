Josh is a historian of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain, focusing on agrarian and industrial transformations. He completed his PhD at the University of Exeter in 2019. Since then, he has taught at the University of Bristol and been a researcher at the Gender, Place and Memory research cluster at the University of Hull. Before joining The Alan Turing Institute, he held an Economic History Society fellowship and was based in the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure (Campop) at the University of Cambridge.
Josh’s research examines the causes, timing, and effects of the British Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. His doctoral research focused on developing new ways of measuring changes to farming and rural society and their relationship to modern economic growth. At the Turing, Josh works on the Living with Machines project, where he is using digitised historical census data to re-assess what we know about industrialisation and how it impacted peoples' lives.
