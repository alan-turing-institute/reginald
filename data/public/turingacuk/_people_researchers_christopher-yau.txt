Christopher is Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oxford in a joint position between Nuffield Department for Women's and Reproductive Health and the Nuffield Department of Population Health. His group is based at the Big Data Institute. He is also Director of the Health Data Research-Alan Turing Institute Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science and a recipient of the UKRI Turing Artificial Intelligence Fellowship.
Christopher was previously Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Manchester, a Turing AI Fellow and Director of the Health Data Research UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science. He received his undergraduate degree in Engineering at the University of Cambridge in 2004 and a D.Phil in Statistics from the University of Oxford in 2009. He was also previously a Lecturer in Statistics at Imperial College London, Associate Professor in Genomic Medicine at the University of Oxford, and Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Birmingham.
His research is focused on issues related to the interpretation of high-dimensional data arising from modern molecular technologies and health systems and how such data can be used to give insights into the molecular basis of human disease particularly cancer. His efforts in this area span a spectrum of areas from core statistical and machine learning methodological research to wet lab-based experimental investigations to translational clinical research. He currently co-leads the Machine Learning Clinical Interpretation Partnership as part of the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project. He is a recipient of a UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship.
