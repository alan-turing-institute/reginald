Evelina is Principal Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, focusing on open source activities in the research engineering group and the wider institute. She is passionate about making data science understandable and accessible to everyone. She is part of the Leadership Team of the Research Engineering Group and currently a co-investigator on two major projects in the Turing:
She is a member of the Volunteer Leadership Team of the Tools, Practices and Systems Turing programme, focusing on open source strategy for open infrastructure.
In 2022, Evelina became Vice President of the Society of Research Software Engineering.
She originally started as a programmer but got interested in machine learning early on and did a mathematics PhD at the University of Cambridge. During her PhD, she worked on Bayesian models for unsupervised learning that integrate heterogeneous biomedical datasets. After that she worked in cancer research at the MRC Cancer unit in Cambridge, where she focused on infrastructure to helping biologists analyse genomic data.
Outside of academia, she is also an avid speaker at developer conferences and she was awarded the Microsoft MVP award for her work in the F# community.
