Rosemary (Rose) Luckin is Professor of Learner Centred Design at UCL Knowledge Lab. Rose’s research involves the design and evaluation of educational technology using theories from the learning sciences and techniques from Artificial Intelligence. She has a particular interest in how AI techniques can be used to enable more effective, continuous, formative assessment processes and tools. Her 2018 book: Machine Learning and Human Intelligence: The Future of Education for the 21st Century describes how we can best benefit from using AI to support teaching and learning, and how the prevalence of AI in our future means that we need to revise what and how we teach and learn now. She has also published numerous academic articles, authored two monographs and edited two paper collections.
Rose is also Director of EDUCATE: a London hub for Educational Technology Start-ups, researchers and educators to work together on the development of evidence-informed Educational Technology; Specialist Adviser to the UK House of Commons Education Select Committee for their inquiry into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Co-founder of the Institute for Ethical AI in Education; President-elect of the International Society for AI in Education; a member of the UK Office for Students Horizon Scanning panel, adviser to the AI and Robotics panel of the Topol review into the future of the NHS workforce; a member of the European AI Alliance, holder of an International Francqui Chair at KU Leuven. Rose was named as one of the 20 most influential people in Education on the Seldon List 2017.
Rose is a member of the computing college of the EPSRC and has advised research councils in various countries. The total value of the grants she has had funded to date is in excess of £15 million and further applications are in process. She has also acted as an advisor for various organisations including: DfE, BIS, Pearson, BBC, McGrawHill Education.
