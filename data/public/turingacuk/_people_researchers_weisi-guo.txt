Dr. Weisi Guo is a Professor of Human Machine Intelligence at Cranfield University, and an Honorary Professor at University of Warwick. He graduated from the University of Cambridge with degrees in General Engineering and Computer Science.
Dr Guo's research expertise is in information and networks. In terms of applications, he is particularly interested in interdependent critical infrastructures and urban analytics for defence and security. His pioneering research in molecular signalling and complex networks has won him a number of awards & nominations. At the Turing, he focuses on using complexity and data science techniques to improve engineering safety and reduce conflict likelihood [1].
