Cryptocurrencies are currently the most developed example of the forthcoming Token Economy. While most of the attention has been so far on the design aspect of the next token, surprisingly little is known about the dynamics generated by the interaction between developers, users, traders and regulators of cryptocurrencies. Complex Systems Science offers the conceptual and technical tools to make sense of the emergent behaviour of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and to anticipate the potential feedback loops between the latter and the broader society.
 
Please note that this event is not managed by The Alan Turing Institute directly; the registration link will direct you to a third-party page. Please address any queries to Andrea Baronchelli.
The event will bring together experts from academia and the industry to talk about how Complexity can help make sense of what is happening in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and how open data from cryptocurrencies can help test and advance theories of Complexity. The event will include a number of invited talks aimed to be accessible to the intended audience of researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and public agencies.
