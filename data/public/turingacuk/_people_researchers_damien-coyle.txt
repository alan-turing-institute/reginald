Professor Damien Coyle is a Director of The Bath Institute for the Augmented Human (University of Bath) and a UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellow 2021-25. His research focuses on developing AI to address challenges associated with translating electrophysiological signals into control signals for brain-computer interface (BCI) based neurotechnology and trialling these developments on a large scale.
He has published over 150 research papers in areas such as computational intelligence/AI, bio-signal processing, computational neuroscience, neuroimaging, neurotechnology and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and has won a number of prestigious international awards including the 2008 IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, the 2011 International Neural Network Society (INNS) Young Investigator of the Year Award and the IET and E&T Innovation of the Year Award 2018.
He was an Ulster University Distinguished Research Fellow in 2011, a Royal Academy of Engineering/The Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellow in 2013, a Royal Academy of Engineering Enterprise Fellow in 2016-2017 and is currently an Ulster Senior Distinguished Research Fellow. 
He is a founding member of the International Brain-Computer Interface Society, an IEEE Brain Steering Committee member, an advisory board member for the UK Neurotechnology Innovation Network, and chairs the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) UK-Ireland chapter. He is Founder and CEO of NeuroCONCISE Ltd, an award-winning, AI-enabled, wearable neurotechnology company.
