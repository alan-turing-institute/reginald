Bogdan is a final year PhD student in mathematics at the University of Oxford. There, he has been trained as an applied mathematician as part of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM) and the Numerical Analysis Group. 
His research is on grid-free compressed sensing/super-resolution under the supervision of Professor Jared Tanner and Dr Andrew Thompson and his project is in collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory.
Previously, he received a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Manchester and he worked as a software developer in the financial sector in London for three years.
Bogdan is interested in techniques for infering useful information from high-dimentional data. Specifically, he focuses on the mathematical approach to super-resolution, or grid-free compressed sensing, a field which was started when mathematicians took an interest in how we can improve the resolution of a microscope beyond the limit imposed by the laws of physics.
The work done by Bogdan so far has been on the stability properties of the super-resolution problem. This gives us an insight into how well we can recover a sparse signal when the measurements are corrupted by noise. 
For the rest of his PhD, and during his time at the Turing, Bogdan will work on the analysis of super-resolution algorithms. His PhD will conclude with the application of such algorithms to relevant datasets, for example from single-molecule fluorescence microscopy or localisation of ships in a shipping lane.
