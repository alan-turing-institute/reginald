As AI becomes ubiquitous in everyday life, closing the gender gap in the AI and data science workforce matters. The fields are particularly fast-moving, so it is important to comprehensively map how these gaps are manifest across different industries, occupations, and skills.
This policy briefing from The Alan Turing Institute’s Women in Data Science and AI project is a contribution to this endeavour, charting women’s participation in data science and AI in the UK and other countries. By presenting a new, curated dataset, analysed through innovative data science methodology, we are able to explore in detail the gendered dynamics of data science.
Our research findings reveal extensive disparities between women and men in skills, status, pay, seniority, industry, job, attrition and educational background. We therefore call for effective policy responses if society is to reap the benefits of technological advances.
