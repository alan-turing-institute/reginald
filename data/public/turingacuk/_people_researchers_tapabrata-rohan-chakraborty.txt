Tapabrata (Rohan) is a Senior Research Associate with the Turing-Roche Partnership. His main area of research is clinical machine learning and health data science, with a particular focus on cancer image analysis. Before joining The Alan Turing Institute, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Big Data Institute, Oxford University, where he collaborated with Roche on the UKRI DART lung cancer programme. He continues to be affiliated with the University of Oxford through a non-stipendiary research fellowship with Linacre College, Oxford under the Oxford University collegiate system. He completed his PhD in Computer Science in New Zealand, his doctoral research won the Diane Campbell Hunt Memorial Award.
Tapabrata (Rohan) is also a passionate educator. He is the Lead Tutor in Information Engineering at the Dept of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. He leads a team of 8 tutors for this highly popular course and teaches image/signal analysis and bayesian estimation/inference. He is a Tutor at the Oxford Centre for Doctoral Training in Health Data Science where he teaches the modules on deep learning and medical image analysis. He is a Senior Member of IEEE, Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (UK), Associate Editor for Springer Nature Computer Science, and an Invited Expert with the Global Partnership on AI for their international project on responsible AI for drug discovery and social good.
As a rambler, he likes to go on long nature walks and hikes. He likes to play pool and attend Oxford college dinners with his friends.
As the first senior research associate with the Turing-Roche strategic partnership, Tapabrata (Rohan) is leading the effort in scoping out relevant research pieces aligned with the north star of the programme. He will also be responsible in proof of concept research on those projects and publish the results through leading scientific outlets. Besides these primary objectives, he also contributes to other initiatives of the partnership like the planning of Turing-Roche workshops, science communication and collaboration with the expert panel.
