The Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice (ADJRP) project aims to widen the lens of current thinking around data justice and to provide actionable resources that will help policymakers, practitioners, and impacted communities gain a broader understanding of what equitable, freedom-promoting, and rights-sustaining data collection, governance, and use should look like in increasingly dynamic and global data innovation ecosystems. In this integrated literature review and annotated bibliography we hope to lay the conceptual groundwork needed to support this aspiration. The endeavour to broaden current visions of what data justice is (and what it could become) involves not only building on the considerable insights that have accrued since the inception of the field less than a decade ago. It also involves identifying where the study of data justice has—thus far—fallen short of engaging with and integrating the perspectives and wisdom of those significantly impacted by the subject matter it broaches. It involves distinguishing where limited fields of vision in the current academic literature, gaps in disciplinarily anchored understandings, and listening deficits in scholarship and policymaking, have cramped the analytical and normative scope of its concerns, conclusions, and proposed solutions.

This report was commissioned by the International Centre of Expertise in Montréal in collaboration with GPAI's Data Governance Working Group, and produced by the Alan Turing Institute. The research was supported, in part, by a grant from ESRC (ES/T007354/1), Towards Turing 2.0 under the EPSRC Grant EP/W037211/1, and from the public funds that make the Turing's Public Policy Programme possible.
