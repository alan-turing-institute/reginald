Our long-term vision is for the Turing to be the centre of a connected network that brings together academic expertise from the UK’s world-class university sector with industry, government, and third sector partners and collaborators to research, catalyse, apply, and drive global impact in data science and AI. The Turing networks will encourage direct connections between universities, partners and other communities we reach and provide an important benchmark for the success of the Institute in driving the data science and artificial intelligence agenda in the UK.
We collaborate with industry to work on real life use cases for data science, with universities to engage with a broad pool of talent and expertise and with public bodies to ensure data science is effectively and safely employed for public good.
We work with a wide range of organisations to help deliver our mission of using data science and artificial intelligence to change the world.
Tackle the thorniest challenges. We bring together different disciplines to develop solutions to hard methodological and real-world problems in the field of data science and artificial intelligence and in accordance with our charitable objects.
Generate public benefit from our work, through open publication, driving societal and economic impact. We want the results, outputs and outcomes of our work to spread beyond single projects, across domains and sectors, yielding positive transformation.
Uphold the highest ethical standards. All our research is subject to ethical review and the Institute demonstrates leadership in data and AI ethics. 
Make more progress together. We bring different research disciplines, diverse researchers, data scientists and engineers together to do what no single entity can do alone. 
Support the adoption and further development of our outputs and outcomes. We want the theories, methods, tools, practices, systems and guidance developed through the Institute to add value to the UK national and international ecosystem. We support our partners to use our findings, build on them, and embed the learnings. We prefer the co-design of collaborative research over consultancy or contract research. 
Work with real-world data. We already work with open data and synthetic data. Our partnerships provide privileged access to confidential, sensitive and proprietary data. 
Activate the enthusiasm, curiosity and commitment of your people and ours.
The Alan Turing Institute works with a wide number of organisations, including government, charities, companies and universities to undertake world-leading research to change the world for the better.
