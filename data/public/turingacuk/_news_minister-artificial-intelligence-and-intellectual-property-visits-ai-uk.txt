Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, Viscount Camrose, visited The Alan Turing Institute’s national showcase event today (Tuesday 22 March).  
The minister arrives at AI UK as The Alan Turing Institute launches its new strategy focusing its efforts on addressing some of the most pressing issues facing the world today in health, the environment and sustainability, defence and national security, and our increasingly digitised society. 

Viscount Camrose visited London’s zero carbon underground farm exhibition showing the work being done at the world’s first underground farm. The farm is shaping the future of urban farming through sustainable and hydroponic farming techniques. And everything happening at the farm is measured and represented in a virtual 3D digital twin at a laboratory in Cambridge to ensure the plants on the farm get exactly what they need at every moment of every day.  

He also spoke to researchers working on a modelling system that leverages data science and AI to determine how land is best used in the UK. This project, which sees The Alan Turing Institute partner with the Geospatial Commission, aims to ensure the UK can meet challenging net zero and biodiversity targets while also delivering infrastructure and economic growth. 

Viscount Camrose was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology earlier this month.
