Iacopo Iacopini is a second year PhD Student in Mathematics at Queen Mary University of London within the Complex Systems and Networks Research Group, where he works under the supervision of Vito Latora and Elsa Arcaute (CASA, UCL). He is also collaborating with the Dynamical Systems and Statistical Physics Group as part of the LoBaNet project. Before, he was a Researcher at ISI Foundation (Turin) and a Data Science Intern at United Nations - UPU (Bern).
Iacopo's research interests include Complex Networks and Data Science, with a particular focus on spatial and social networks and their data driven application to the study of human behaviour in the urban environment. His main PhD project deals with the mathematical modelling of urban systems and the interplay between spatial interaction models and mobile phone data.
