Regulators, researchers, and professional investors are interested in the impact that proposed financial policies, trading algorithms, and agent behaviour have on financial systems. This interest follows from an onslaught of flash-crashes that has led to a call for improved market stability. The problem is that purely studying the record of the past only gives us a glimpse of a single world view. To study a true counterfactual there is a need to model the financial system and its interacting parts in all its complexity. To do this we have to, at first, set aside reductive economic theories and focus on modelling complex adaptive systems. In recent years multi-agent based systems have been the prevailing paradigm to model realistic financial environments. Current machine learning innovations like deep supervised and reinforcement learning have also played an important role in accurately modelling advanced algorithmic methods. In this workshop, we bring together the world’s thought leaders on this subject.
