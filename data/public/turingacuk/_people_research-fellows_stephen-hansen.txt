Stephen Hansen is an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of University College. He received his BSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics and PhD in Economics from the London School of Economics. Previously he was Assistant then Associate Professor at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.
Stephen is primarily interested in organisational economics, with a particular focus on central bank design. He has worked on projects that examine the optimal structure of monetary policy committees, the impact of reputational incentives on policy dynamics, and the behavioural effects of transparency. Recently he has begun to incorporate unstructured text data into his research, which has led to a cross-over interest in statistical learning for high-dimensional discrete data.
