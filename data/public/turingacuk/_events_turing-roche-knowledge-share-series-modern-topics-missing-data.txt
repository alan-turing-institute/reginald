An event series for Turing-Roche partnership updates, knowledge sharing and new perspectives. Find out more about the series.
This event will be diving into the topic of missing data- a common problem that arises in many fields that can significantly complicate analysis. 
During this event you will hear from Dr Robin Mitra, Senior Lecturer in Mathematics from Cardiff University and Dr Chris Harbron, Expert Statistical Scientist and Advanced Analytics Lead at Roche.
Robin will be giving us an introduction to missing data, what problems it can cause and how we can deal with it. An illustration will also be provided, involving a study on survival times after receiving an organ transplant.
Chris will introduce us to the concept of 'structured missingness', lay out some of the main challenges and emerging areas for research around this concept and share some of the work the partnership has started in characterising the different types of missing data.
As well as having a Q&A at the event, we hope to have discussions about this area pre and post the event via our Turing-Roche Slack Workspace which you can join here. 
You can watch a recording of this event here.
