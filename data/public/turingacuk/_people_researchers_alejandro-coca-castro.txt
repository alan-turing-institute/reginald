Alejandro (he/him) is a Research Fellow of the Data Science for Science and Humanities and Honorary Member of the Tools, Practices and Systems programmes at The Alan Turing Institute. He holds a PhD in Physical Geography with a MSc. in Environmental Monitoring, Modelling and Management at King’s College London. He has 11+ years of experience in applied artificial intelligence and data science for Earth Systems, Agricultural and Environmental sciences. He has contributed to a wide variety of international institutions in the public, research and industry sectors developing pipelines and tools to process and analyse data (spatial and non-spatial) for decision making.
When he is not too busy doing geeky things, Alejandro enjoys reading sci-fi books, cycling and coffee tasting.
Alejandro's main research includes modelling Earth systems and Environmental phenomena using artificial intelligence and data science. He is currently evaluating probabilistic data-driven models for the intelligent fusion of data from a wide range of sources (satellite, reanalysis, in-situ surface sensors, among others) to predict environmental and climate.
Beside his involvement in scientific and applied research challenges, he is an active contributor and lead in open science education and open-source development. For instance, he is founder of the Environmental Data Science book, a computational notebook community promoting open source software, reproducibility and collaborative research in Environmental science. In addition, he has contributed to software development, tutorials, content and events led by community-driven initiatives including Scivision (core member), the Turing Way (core member), Open Life Science (mentee/mentor) and Pangeo (member).
