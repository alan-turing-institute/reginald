Around the world, digital participation platforms are being used as a tool for direct democracy, aiming to empower citizens to contribute to policy making. As trust in traditional democratic institutions declines, these deliberative platforms offer a way to build new relationships and trust between citizens and policy-makers.
However, experience suggests that the popularity of these direct democracy initiatives and the sheer volume of proposals can make it difficult for citizens and policy-makers to make sense of them. Hence, common objectives may prove difficult to achieve; paradoxically, the consequence may be to reduce the willingness of citizens to get involved in direct democracy initiatives.
Understanding this challenge as a unique opportunity, researchers at the Turing are joining forces with Consul, the world's most popular digital participation platform, to create new opportunities for citizen engagement in policy-making by combining human collective intelligence with machine learning.
At this event, speakers will present on how machine learning techniques can be applied to digital democracy platforms to enhance citizen engagement in policy making.
Speakers will present on the Consul project, on how machine learning is being used to enhance citizen’s experiences of direct democracy, new cases of direct democracy in Scotland and the Netherlands, and more advanced applications of machine learning in this critically important domain.
The event is open to members of the general public interested in digital direct democracy, experts in machine learning and natural language processing, and policy-makers.
Draft agenda for "Citizen participation and machine learning for a better democracy"
