Craig Silverman is an award-winning author and journalist and one of the world's leading experts on online misinformation, fake news, and media manipulation. He is the media editor of BuzzFeed News, where he leads a team covering how our information environment is being shaped and exploited. 

Every digital product or service can be gamed or exploited, and this is especially true of today’s media and information environment. Whether it’s Russian trolls trying to create division in a democracy, marketers scheming to get the best reviews for their product, or criminals stealing billions thanks to ad fraud, our media environment is more open to manipulation than ever before. This talk exposes how it’s being done, and outlines ways to reclaim the media space from frauds and fakers.
The talk will be followed by an audience Q&A and drinks reception. Email your questions ahead of the event to Turing Events.
