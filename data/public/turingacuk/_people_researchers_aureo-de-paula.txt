Dr. Aureo de Paula received his B.A. and M.Sc. in Economics from Pontificia Universidade Catolica—RJ (Brazil) in 1996 and 2000 respectively, he then went on to complete his M.A. and Ph.D. in Economics at Princeton University in 2002 and 2006. Prior to joining University College London (UCL), he was an associate professor (with tenure) at the University of Pennsylvania and has been a visiting faculty scholar at Northwestern and Harvard universities. Aureo is an elected Fellow of the Econometric Society and the International Association for Applied Econometrics and a Turing Fellow in 2021/22. He is an elected member of the Econometric Society Council from 2022 and a director for the Review of Economic Studies. Professor de Paula is affiliated with the Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (UK), the Institute for Fiscal Studies (UK), CEPR and several other research groups worldwide.
Professor de Paula’s work has been featured in various academic publications and he has been associate editor for various academic journals (The Review of Economic Studies, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, Econometrics Journal, Econometric Reviews) and was a managing editor for The Review of Economics Studies. He has won the Irving B. Kravis Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching at the University of Pennsylvania and the Faculty Education Award at UCL (joint with Dunli Li).
