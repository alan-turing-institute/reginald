Sundeep works at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) the UK’s National Measurement Institute, responsible for measurement strategy and delivery in the UK. NPL (the home of atomic time keeping, packet switching and once Alan Turing himself) develops and maintains the national primary measurement standards and is a Public Corporation owned by HMG's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
Sundeep’s work focuses on shaping the evolution of physical metrology and measurement into the ‘cyber-physical’ world, embedding measurement and traceability into processes using digital and data sciences to deliver confidence in the intelligent and effective use of data. NPL’s more recent work address’ research and development in measurement standards that provide traceability and confidence in end-end digital process’, as well as develop the assets required in the future to underpin and enable economies and societies to have confidence in ‘data driven decision making at the speed of AI’. Sundeep sits on multiple cross-government and departmental steering boards and coordination groups that cover digital technologies and digital technology standards. He has led NPL’s involvement in the partnership tasked with establishing the UK Governments International AI Standards Hub Pilot.
