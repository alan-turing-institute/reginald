Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb is a Reader in Applied and Computational Analysis at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), University of Cambridge since 2015. There, she is head of the Cambridge Image Analysis group, Director of the Cantab Capital Institute for Mathematics of Information, Co-Director of the EPSRC Centre for Mathematical and Statistical Analysis of Multimodal Clinical Imaging, and since 2011 a fellow of Jesus College Cambridge. Her current research interests focus on variational methods and partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing and inverse imaging problems.
Her research has been acknowledged by scientific prizes, among them the LMS Whitehead Prize 2016, and by invitations to give plenary lectures at several renowned applied mathematics conference, among them the SIAM conference on Imaging Science in 2014, the SIAM conference on Partial Differential Equations in 2015, the IMA Conference on Challenges of Big Data in 2016 and the SIAM annual meeting in 2017. Carola graduated from the Institute for Mathematics, University of Salzburg (Austria) in 2004. From 2004 to 2005 she held a teaching position in Salzburg. She received her PhD degree from the University of Cambridge in 2009. After one year of postdoctoral activity at the University of Göttingen (Germany), she became a Lecturer in at DAMTP in 2010, promoted to Reader in 2015.
She is interested in the interaction of mathematical sciences and imaging. She studies non-smooth and possibly non-convex variational methods and nonlinear partial differential equations for image analysis and inverse imaging problems, among them image reconstruction and restoration, object segmentation, and dynamic image reconstruction and analysis such as fast flow imaging, object tracking and motion analysis in videos.
Moreover, she works on computational methods for large-scale and high-dimensional problems appearing in, e.g. image classification and 3D and 4D imaging. Within this context she is interested in both the rigorous theoretical and computational analysis of the problems considered as well as their practical implementation and their use for real-world applications. Currently, her research focuses on customising variational image analysis and image reconstruction models to applications by learning their setup from real-world data training sets.
To this end she investigates so-called bilevel optimisation techniques in which the solution is typically constrained to a non-smooth variational problem or a nonlinear PDE. She has active interdisciplinary collaborations with clinicians, biologists and physicists on biomedical imaging topics, chemical engineers and plant scientists on image sensing, as well as collaborations with artists and art conservators on digital art restoration.
