The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) is the financial regulator for the Netherlands. While the Dutch Central Bank focuses on the stability of the Dutch financial markets, the AFM is responsible for regulating the behaviour on the Dutch financial markets. As such, its responsibilities include supervising sectors such Accountancy, Insurance, Asset Management, and the capital markets. The AFM’s main objective is contributing to transparent and fair financial markets. Since Brexit, the AFM is supervising the largest European Trading Venues, encompassing both equities, bonds, and commodities. The AFM has around 600 full time employees and is headquartered in Amsterdam.
