Pica is a Research Associate on the Online Safety Team at The Alan Turing Institute. She also has experience working with policymakers in UK Parliament on the forthcoming Online Safety Bill. Pica holds a Master’s Degree in Media, Data and Society from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), where she graduated with an excellence award for achieving the highest mark in her program cohort. At LSE her research focused on white supremacist discourse. Prior to joining the Turing, Pica worked as a communications analyst at the UN Refugee Agency.
At the the Turing, Pica is helping develop the Online Harms Survey and the Online Harms Observatory. In August 2022 she co-authored the Turing's report "Tracking abuse on Twitter against football players in the 2021-22 Premier League Season", commissioned by Ofcom and supported by the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport. She is also responsible for the team's stakeholder engagement with key policymakers, civil society and other experts in the online safety space.
