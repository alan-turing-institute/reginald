This one-day workshop aims to generate advancements in data science and AI technologies and accelerate their adoption across the Space sector.  It aims to generate increased activity at the Turing Institute in the area of Space, in particular aligned to Spacecraft Systems Engineering and the Data-Centric Engineering programme and to develop a wider network of researchers using and developing Data Science and AI, across Space Science and Engineering.
 
The Universities of Southampton and Strathclyde are jointly organizing this event with the support of The Alan Turing Institute. It will cover two themes: Space Science and Space System Engineering and will look at how the different disciplines can work more closely together going forward.  Each theme will reflect on the AI requirement in each sector, current national activity and how the Turing Institute can provide value.
The co-Chairs are Professor Adam Sobey, University of Southampton and Programme Director for Turing’s Data-Centric Engineering Programme, Dr Annalisa Riccardi, University of Strathclyde, and Professor Francesco Shankar, University of Southampton and Turing Fellow.
 
In order to bring together key Data Science and AI experts from across the network to explore potential collaboration and meet the goals of this workshop, registration for this event will be invitation-only in the first instance. The list of invited applicants includes a number of Turing Fellows and Turing-affiliated researchers.  The remaining spaces will be filled through an open invitation. If oversubscribed, the organisers will assess/accept applicants to ensure the goals of the workshop are met.
Interested participants should contact the organiser Susan Davies at [email protected]      
The keynote talks by Dr Ingo Waldman, UCL and Turing Fellow, and Dr Audrey Berquand, European Space Agency, will be live-streamed and open to anyone to attend online.  Please register via the above links – the closing date for registration is 29 June.
