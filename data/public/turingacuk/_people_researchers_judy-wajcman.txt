Judy Wajcman is Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics (LSE). Until 2022, she held the Anthony Giddens Chair in Sociology at the LSE. Prior to joining the LSE in 2009, she was the Professor of Sociology in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University. She has held posts in Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Sydney, Warwick, most recently holding the Mellon Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University (2017-18).
She was President of the Society for Social Studies of Science (2009-2011) and is currently a Visiting Professor at the Oxford Internet Institute. In 2013, she was the recipient of the William F. Ogburn Career Achievement Award of the American Sociological Association. Professor Wajcman has an honorary doctorate from the University of Geneva, and she is a Fellow of the British Academy. In 2018, she received the Oxford Internet Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award ‘in recognition of her contributions to the field of the social study of science and technology'.
She is a member of the AI100 Standing Committee.
Judy has published widely in the fields of science and technology studies, feminist theory, work and organisations. She is probably best known for her analysis of the gendered nature of technology. Her books include The Social Shaping of Technology, Feminism Confronts Technology, Managing Like a Man: Women and Men in Corporate Management, TechnoFeminism, The Politics of Working Life, The Sociology of Speed, and Pressed for Time: The Acceleration of Life in Digital Capitalism, which was awarded the 2017 Ludwik Fleck prize by the Society for the Social Studies of Science. Her work has been translated into Chinese, French, German, Greek, Korean, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian. Her current research is about the impact of digital technologies on the experience of time in everyday life.
