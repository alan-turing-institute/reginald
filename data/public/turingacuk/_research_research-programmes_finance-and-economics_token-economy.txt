Blockchains and smart contracts allow everyone to create tokens that can be used as media of exchange, represent an asset or be employed to reinforce and build desirable behaviours. However, how to design and apply tokens is still unclear due to the ever-complicated relationship between software engineering, human behaviour and the complex socio-technical systems we form and inhabit.
This programme challenge, or special interest group, aims to put together researchers and industrial partners interested in understanding the socio-economic implications of tokens. The goal is to investigate the current usage of tokens in order to improve the design of future tokens, minimise potential risks for users and maximise potential societal benefits.
Andrea Baronchelli took part in the NFTs & the future of digital art session at CogX 2021. The session was co-curated by CogX and The Alan Turing Institute.
