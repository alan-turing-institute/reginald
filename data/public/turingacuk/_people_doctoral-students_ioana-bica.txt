Ioana is a second year Doctoral student at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. She is supervised by Professor Mihaela van der Schaar and co-supervised by Professor Pietro Lio. She has previously completed a BA and MPhil in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge where she has specialised in machine learning and its applications to biomedicine. Ioana has worked on research projects involving integration of transcriptomics and epigenomics data using cross-modal neural networks, variational autoencoders for modelling gene expression data and neural network interpretability.
Ioana’s doctoral research focuses on developing machine learning methods aimed at improving healthcare and advancing medical research. She has worked on building methods for causal inference and individualised treatment effect estimation from observational data. In particular, she has developed machine learning methods capable of estimating the heterogeneous effects of time-dependent treatments, thus enabling us to determine when to give treatments to patients and how to select among multiple treatments over time. Recently, Ioana has started working on methods for understanding and modelling clinical decision making through causality and inverse reinforcement learning.
