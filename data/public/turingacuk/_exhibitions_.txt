Researchers at King's College London are looking at ways we can learn more about and better treat heart conditions like arrhythmias and heart failure. By creating a digital replica of a person's heart, the “digital twin” of the heart can be used to predict responses that cannot be obtained experimentally; for example, to see what a patient's response to a particular treatment method might be. These models can also be 3D printed to understand better their shape. Drop by this demo – part of the TRIC-DT group – to learn more, find out what these digital twins look like and even see how pacemakers have evolved over time.
