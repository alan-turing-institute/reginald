May is a Senior Research Software Engineer at The Alan Turing Institute. She has worked across multiple research domains, collaborating with scientists to turn interesting ideas into useable software. Past projects include machine learning on neonatal intensive care data and tools for enabling the exploration of UK government expenditure data.
She has previously worked on creating data standards for antibody therapy experiments at UCL Cancer Institute and worked on amalgamation of heterogeneous multiple sclerosis data at the Imperial Data Science Institute.
May is interested in data interpretation, specifically ways of providing information in perspective in order to see the bigger picture. She is building tools to minimise data ambiguity so that data is interpreted and used the way the data collectors intended.
