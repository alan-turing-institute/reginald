Vicky Hellon is the Community Manager for the Turing-Roche Partnership. She will be working closely with both organisations to build an engaged and sustainable community around the partnership, with a focus on supporting researchers to embrace and embed Open Science practices.
Vicky has a BSc in Biomedical Science from the University of Sheffield and previously had roles in Open Access publishing at Springer Nature and F1000Research. At F1000Research she worked in researcher outreach, particularly in Bioinformatics communities and also delivered Open Access publishing services for funders and institutions, most notably as project lead for HRB Open Research and NIHR Open Research. More recently she worked at Health Data Research UK, building a community around the newly launched Health Data Research Innovation Gateway, a portal to help researchers discover and request access to UK health datasets.
She is passionate about supporting forward-thinking changes to the academic publishing system and engaging with researchers from a range of backgrounds.
