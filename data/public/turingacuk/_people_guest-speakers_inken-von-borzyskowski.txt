Inken von Borzyskowski is Assistant Professor of Political Science at University College London, having previously been on the faculty at Florida State University. She received her Ph.D. in International Relations, Methodology, and Comparative Politics at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
She is originally from Berlin where she received a Postdoctoral research fellowship and previously an M.A. at Free University Berlin. She has been a research fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) in Washington, D.C., and a consultant at the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP).
Her research focuses on the domestic politics of international relations with an emphasis on international organizations and their effect on domestic conflict and elections. Specifically, her research falls into three areas: international democracy assistance; the causes and consequences of election violence; and international organizations’ membership politics. In her first book, she develops and tests a theory of how international organizations can influence election violence by changing election credibility.
Her research is published in International Studies Quarterly, British Journal of Political Science, Journal of Peace Research, Review of International Organizations, and Cornell University Press.
