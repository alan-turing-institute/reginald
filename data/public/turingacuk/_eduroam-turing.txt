The Institute is a participating organisation in eduroam(UK). ‘eduroam’, which stands for education roaming, is an international initiative that allows members of educational establishments to gain internet access at other member organisations easily and securely using credentials from their home organisation. Find out more about eduroam.
The Turing qualifies as both a home and visited organisation for eduroam services:
Home organisation
This allows Turing users who are visiting an institution which is a member of eduroam (including eduroam(UK)) to access the network using their Turing credentials; normally in the format of [email protected]
Visited organisation
This allows visitors from other member institutions to the Turing to access the network using the credentials provided by their home institution. If your institution isn’t a participating organisation you will need to use the guest wifi.
