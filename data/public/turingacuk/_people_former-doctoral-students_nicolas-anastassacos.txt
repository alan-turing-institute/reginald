Nicolas started his doctoral studies at The Alan Turing Institute in October 2017. He is registered at the UCL. Having completed a BSc Cognitive Science from the University of Edinburgh and MSc Data Science from UCL, Nicolas looks to combine these disciplines in his research to understand behaviour and social contexts from a data-driven perspective.
Nicolas’s current research interests involve studying human behaviour on both an individual and collective scale, looking to analyze how behaviour changes with respect to the environment and determining optimal ways of behaving using reinforcement learning techniques and game theory. His other interests involve personality-based modelling and developing multi-agent systems.
