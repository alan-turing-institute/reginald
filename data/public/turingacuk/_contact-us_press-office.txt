As the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence (AI), the Turing is a hub for over 400 national and international experts focusing on how data and AI shape and impact our lives today.   
We work in partnership with universities, industry, and public and third sector organisations, gathering insights and speaking with a unique and independent voice. We bring an interdisciplinary perspective to some of the most pressing challenges in science, society and the economy that require cross-boundary thinking. 
Our strengths lie in marrying technical expertise with an understanding of the wider ethical, legal and policy landscape.

Our research has been featured in publications such as Nature, Wired, the Financial Times, MIT Technology Review, and New Scientist and on programmes such as BBC local radio and Woman’s Hour, Talking Machines, Guardian science podcast, and the Economist’s Babbage podcast. 
Following the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, Turing researchers have taken part in dozens of media and speaking engagements to support understanding around these rapidly emerging technologies. Early interviews in the Telegraph, the Guardian on BBC Radio 5Live and Tonight with Andrew Marr on LBC set the scene for how this technology could work. 
Since then, Professor Mike Wooldridge, Director of Foundational AI Research, has been interviewed extensively. Highlights include a piece in The Times and BBC Futures and multiple radio interviews for the BBC World Service and BBC Radio 4.
Professor Wooldridge has also been interviewed on Britain’s computing power for articles in The Telegraph, The Times and Tech Monitor. Additionally, he provided comment in The Telegraph and The Times to the news that Britain needs its own ‘sovereign’ AI.
Dr Mhairi Aitken has also been interviewed by many media outlets including the Daily Mail, the Today Programme and Woman’s Hour on BBC Radio 4, New Scientist, Cosmopolitan, and BBC Two about other uses for this technology and the competition from Google’s rival chatbot, Bard which launched in February 2023.
Other recent and notable coverage includes the Turing’s Drew Hemment on BBC Radio 4’s Moral Maze, Mike Wooldridge featuring on the 30-minute Radio 4 programme, The Briefing Room, an interview with Mhairi on LBC about the impact of AI on jobs and on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme in April discussing the importance of regulating against existing AI risks, and Dr Adrian Weller on BBC PM’s programme and an interview on Bloomberg about prompt engineering.
