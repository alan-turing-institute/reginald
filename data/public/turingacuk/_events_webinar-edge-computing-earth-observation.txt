After careful consideration, we have decided to host Edge computing for Earth observation workshop online only through Zoom video conferencing. You will not be able to attend in person at the Turing. 
Given public health concerns about the coronavirus we trust that you will understand we wish to prioritise the health and safety of the Turing community and our wider network. 
As the number of satellite launches increases and UAV technology continues to mature, the volume of data for Earth observation is growing at an ever-increasing rate. In order to process and analyse these massive volumes of data, advances have been made in remote sensing platforms and distributed processing. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) forms the basis of Earth observation techniques due to its ability to sense at long range, through cloud cover, by day or by night, with the ability to generate 3D structure observations.
The drive towards multiple distributed, networked RF sensing nodes and automated manning of platforms with reduced human in the loop is pushing research towards developing solutions that can process data in near real time. Technologies enabling distributed processing with low power requirements, and suitable for bandwidth-limited and remote environments, are improving rapidly, particularly those based on FPGAs.
This workshop will look at the advances and challenges in onboard processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence for Earth observation.
 
This one-day interactive workshop aims to bring together a group of Earth scientists with interesting problem sets, data scientists with knowledge of machine learning algorithms and experts in computer architectures for power and bandwidth constrained environments.
The event will enable collaboration across related domains, accelerate our understanding of capabilities and limitations, and bring new functionality to bear on the continually evolving domain of edge computing for Earth observation. 
The event will be split into 5 key themes:
Draft agenda for "Edge computing for Earth observation"
Abstracts for "Edge computing for Earth observation"
Monitoring the resilience of patterned vegetation in the Sahel using Google Earth Engine, Nick Barlow and Camila Rangel Smith (The Alan Turing Institute)
Iterative principal component analysis in dual polarisation SAR images, A Faul and A Fleming (British Antarctic Survey)
Limited spaces are available for this event. Apply to attend is now closed.
