This free 2-day workshop is on the topic of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a branch of AI that deals with language, and spans across many disciplines that make use of text data. NLP is vital in bridging the gap between human language and computers, enabling machines to understand, process, and generate natural language. Its applications are wide-ranging and impactful, transforming the way we communicate, access information, and interact with technology.
The in-person workshop will consist of a mix of invited speakers from research institutions (including Turing Research Fellows) and industry. It is aimed at NLP practitioners and researchers, but all are welcome. PhD students and early career researchers working with NLP are especially encouraged to attend.
The venue for the event  is the Abacws Building, the brand new home of the School of Computer Science and Mathematics at Cardiff University. The expression of interest period is now finished. However, there are still some spaces available. Please contact the event organisers via this webpage for latest availability  (registration deadline is June 9th ).
