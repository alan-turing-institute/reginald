Published on 8 March 2021, International Women’s Day, this policy briefing from the Turing’s Women in Data Science and AI project presents new research into gender gaps in AI and data science, and the extent and impact of men’s dominance in these fields.
A decade ago, Harvard Business Review named data scientists as “the sexiest job of the 21st century.” Since then hiring in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science has exploded as the world is increasingly being built around smart machines and automated systems. 
Yet the people whose work underpins that vision are far from representative of the society those systems are meant to serve.
Only 22% of data and AI professionals in the UK are women, and this drops to a mere 8% of researchers who contribute to the pre-eminent machine learning conferences.
This is not only a fundamental issue of economic equality, but also about how the world is designed and for whom. Mounting evidence (e.g. Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018; West, Whittaker and Chew, 2019) suggests that the under-representation of women and marginalised groups in AI results in a feedback loop whereby bias gets built into and amplified by machine learning systems. 
Addressing the gender job gap in AI is the first step to ensuring that our technology works for all of society.
Existing data is sparse: Raw, intersectional industry data about gender diversity in the AI workforce is severely limited. The available high-level statistics, however, show there are fewer women working in the data and AI fields in the UK compared to the global average. Currently, women make up an estimated 26% of workers in data and AI roles globally, which drops to only 22% in the UK. Further, in the UK, the share of women in engineering and cloud computing is a mere 14% and 9% respectively.
Diverging career trajectories: There is evidence of persistent structural inequality in the data science and AI fields. Women are more likely than men to occupy a job associated with less status and pay in the data and AI talent pool, usually within analytics, data preparation and exploration, rather than the more prestigious jobs in engineering and machine learning.
Job attrition rates: Women working in AI and data science in the tech sector have higher attrition rates (i.e. leaving the industry) than men.
Self-reported skills: Men routinely self-report having more skills than women on LinkedIn. This is consistent across all industries and countries in the sample in the report. This correlates with existing research into women’s lower confidence levels in their own technical abilities.
The qualification gap: Women in data science and AI have higher formal educational levels than men across all industries. The achievement gap is even higher for those in more senior ranks (i.e. for C-suite roles).
Participation in online platforms: Women comprise only about 17% of participants across the online global data science platforms Data Science Central (‘DS Central’), Kaggle and OpenML. On StackOverflow, women are a mere 8%. Additionally, only about 20% of UK data and AI researchers on Google Scholar are women. Of the 45 researchers with more than 10,000 citations, only five were women.
The report shows the extent of gender disparities in careers, education, jobs, seniority, status and skills in the AI and data science fields. Utilising a new, curated dataset and an innovative methodology, it explores the gendered dynamics of careers in the UK and other countries in fresh detail. 
These original findings add urgency to the drive to improve women’s opportunities in the technology industry and highlights the need for effective policy responses if society as a whole is to reap the benefits of technological advances. 
This work has added urgency since the drive to close the gender gap in the technology industry risks being derailed by the pandemic.
As Professor Judy Wajcman, head of the project added: “Diversity in the fields of data science and AI is essential if we do not want to replicate social biases in technical systems.”

Mapping the gender job gap in AI by Erin Young, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Public Policy Programme at The Alan Turing Institute; Judy Wajcman, Principal Investigator of the Women in Data Science and AI project at The Alan Turing Institute, and Anthony Giddens Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics; and Laila Sprejer, a Data Science Research Assistant in the Public Policy Programme at The Alan Turing Institute.
