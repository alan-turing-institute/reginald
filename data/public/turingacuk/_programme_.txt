Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

“One of the most striking aspects of the event was how broad a research area AI is; it was inspiring to see how many different directions one could take. I will continue to recommend the event to people interested in exploring data science further.”
“This has to be the best AI-focused event I’ve attended, thank you to all who worked to put it together. The event highlights that we all have a lot to do to ensure that the AI sector in the UK thrives, but we are doing a lot of work already and the country is really trying to take a leading role, which is fantastic to see.”
“I found it interesting, engaging and thought-provoking. It was particularly fascinating to hear the illuminating perspectives of speakers from Asia, Africa and the Global South.”
“I wanted to congratulate the AI UK team for the excellent level of representation in the event. As a mature woman PhD student from a minority community, I could find someone who reflected me in some way in the various panels. Well done!”
“Besides the motivation, excitement and hope from all the inspirational speakers, AI UK has also re-confirmed my decision to pivot my career and I’m very much looking forward to a role in data science for the public good!”
