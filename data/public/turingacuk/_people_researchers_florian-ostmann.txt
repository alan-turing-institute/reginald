Florian Ostmann is Head of AI Governance and Regulatory Innovation within the Turing's public policy programme. His work focuses on regulation and non-regulatory governance mechanisms related to data and AI as well as on the use of data science and AI to facilitate the work of regulatory bodies. His broader research interests include the ethical implications of emerging technologies, the use of data science and AI to address societal challenges, health policy, and corporate responsibility (with a focus on business and human rights). Recent work led by Florian includes a report examining questions of responsible AI innovation in financial services (commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority) and a project on the use of data to address modern slavery risks in the investment context. Florian serves on the Royal Statistical Society’s Data Science Section Committee and contributed to the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems as a member of the Initiative’s Law Committee. In previous roles, he worked at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, as a consultant on autonomous vehicle policy, social impact measurement, and responsible investing, and for the Pan American Health Organization. Florian holds a Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School and a PhD in Political Philosophy and MA in Legal and Political Theory from University College London.
