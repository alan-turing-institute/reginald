Biomedical AI is revolutionising the way we diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases. In particular, there is an increasing focus on multi-modal data integration for various applications, including the use of omics, imaging and clinical data. New deep learning techniques, including transformers, diffusion models, and generative pre-trained algorithms are also being increasingly explored for biomedical AI applications. There are however several open challenges, and it is therefore important to discuss the recent progress in the field.
The workshop will broadly cover methodological, theoretical and applied research in biomedical AI, with a focus on AI safety and interpretability, which are still unsolved challenges. It will include a mixture of talks from experts in the field and early-career researchers, presenting various case studies.
