Climate variability is widely impacting natural and human systems. One of the many impacts is its potential threat to human security. The role of climate variability as a possible cause of violent conflict has been coming to the forefront of public and scientific debates. In this so-called Climate Security Nexus, climate variability acts as a multidirectional threat multiplier, aggravating existing vulnerabilities of people and communities. We collaborate with CGIAR Focus Climate Security to devise a quantitative framework to develop a Climate Security Index (CSI), for measuring and monitoring climate security vulnerability. Primarily meant for long-term planning and decision making for resilience building, it incorporates a broad range of drivers of the Climate Security Nexus, including those from climatic, conflict, socioeconomic, agricultural, and contextual (i.e., mitigating factors, adaptive capacity) dimensions, to indicate climate-security risks at subnational level. Emphasizing the role of water, land and food systems, a systemic approach, based on innovative modelling tools is envisioned, to account for the underlying relationships within the Climate Security Nexus.
