Dr Oscar Giles is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute. He has a PhD in Cognitive Psychology from the University of Leeds, which involved developing computational models of human sensorimotor control. Before joining the Alan Turing Institute, Oscar worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds, developing portable motion capture systems.
Most recently he worked on models of human road user behaviour as part of a EU Horizon 2020 project to improve interaction between autonomous vehicles and human road users.
Oscar has a strong interest in Bayesian statistical methods and reproducible data analysis. He will be applying his experience in software development, data analysis and statistical modelling to a broad range of research projects at The Alan Turing Institute.
