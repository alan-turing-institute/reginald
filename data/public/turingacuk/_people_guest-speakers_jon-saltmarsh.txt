Jon is Deputy Director, Engineering and Research, within the Science and Innovation for Climate and Energy directorate, in the UK government’s department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.  He is responsible for engineering studies, technical analysis and research that the department undertakes to provide robust technical evidence and advice to underpin policies on reducing energy demand and decarbonising energy supply.  This work covers low carbon generation (e.g. wind, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, solar); energy efficiency (in buildings and industry); fuel switching (e.g. electrification, hydrogen); and integration of solutions (e.g. smart technologies). He leads the disruptive technology theme within the £1 billion net zero innovation portfolio. Jon is also responsible for the UK’s input into international innovation initiatives including Mission Innovation, where he co-leads the innovation community on affordable heating and cooling of buildings.
Prior to joining BEIS, he worked in the private sector on a range of cutting-edge defence technology programmes including solar powered unmanned aircraft, automated landing systems and simulation-based training. 
Jon holds a degree in engineering from St John’s College, University of Cambridge and an MBA from Cranfield University.
