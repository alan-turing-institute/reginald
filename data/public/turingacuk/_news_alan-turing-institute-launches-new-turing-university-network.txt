The Alan Turing Institute has launched the Turing University Network today (Monday 3 April) which provides all UK universities with an interest in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) the opportunity to engage and collaborate both with the Institute and its broader networks.
Thirty six universities from the previous Turing university partners and Turing Network Development Award recipients have joined the pilot network and a call, available to all UK universities, will open in the Spring.
The Turing University Network is a key component of the new Institute Strategy aimed at changing the world for the better with data science and AI. The network supports the Institute in achieving its three ambitious goals: advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges, build skills for the future, and drive an informed public conversation. 
Through the Turing University Network, the Institute will build a structured and inclusive university network representative of the wider data science and AI community in the UK which will facilitate better connections across the data science and AI landscape. The network will be open, with minimal barriers to both entry and bureaucracy, and will provide enablers such as mechanisms to connect across the ecosystem, interesting problems and routes to impact.
Donna Brown, Director of Academic Engagement at The Alan Turing Institute, said: “We’re delighted to launch a new UK-wide university network of data science and AI expertise via the Turing University Network. The network is crucial to successful delivery of the Institute Strategy, enables our role as a national convenor in the data science and AI landscape, and creates opportunity for meaningful collaboration where interests align across research and innovation, skills, and engagement.”
