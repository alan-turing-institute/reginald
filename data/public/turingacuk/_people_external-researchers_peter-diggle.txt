Professor Peter Diggle is a Technical Director of the Turing-RSS Laboratory at The Alan Turing Institute, which supports statistical and machine learning capabilities for the UK’s COVID-19 response, delivered in partnership with the Royal Statistical Society and the Joint Biosecurity Centre. He is a Distinguished University Professor in CHICAS (a teaching and research group within the Lancaster Medical School at Lancaster University), a Trustee for Biometrika, and founding joint editor of Biostatistics. He holds honorary adjunct professorships with Johns Hopkins, Columbia and Yale. He is a former President (2014-2016) of the Royal Statistical Society, former chair of the UK Medical Research Council's Skills Development Fellowships Panel, and current member of the Royal Statistical Society’s COVID-19 Task Force.
Before Peter joined Lancaster University he held positions at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia.
Peter’s research is motivated by applications in the biomedical, clinical or health sciences, but especially in real-time health surveillance and in tropical disease epidemiology. His main methodological research interests are in spatial statistics and longitudinal data analysis.
