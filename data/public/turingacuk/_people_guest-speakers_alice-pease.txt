Alice is a passionate geoscientist broadening her skillset into digital & data architecture technology project management. Her 8-year career has so far spanned technical disciplines, continents, onshore and offshore wellsites, multi-national energy operators and now the public sector in energy transition R&D.
Alice has demonstrable experience in well log data acquisition and interpretation. Such interpretations have fed into high-value decisions while drilling high-pressure/high-temperature wells on the UK Continental Shelf. She has also provided petrophysical evaluations for the purposes of carbon storage.
In her current role at the Net Zero Technology Centre, Alice is responsible for the management of digital & data architecture technology development projects that are funded by the Centre. She is also involved in the technical assessment of technology proposals submitted to the NZTC. Alice manages projects that include R&D towards a proof-of-concept subsea AI body of knowledge (SAIBOK) that will demonstrate the potential for machine learning in subsea inspection. Alice works closely with technology developers, industry partners and academia to ensure projects reflect the business case and operate within the framework governing the use of public funds.
Alice is an Associate Member of the Energy Institute, holds a BSc in Geology-Petroleum Geology and an MSc in Integrated Petroleum Geoscience from the University of Aberdeen. She completed the Maersk International Technology and Science programme in 2016, which included an executive MBA at the University of California – Berkeley, and qualified with IFP Training as a Subsurface Geoscience Operations professional in 2019. Alice is presently undertaking project management certificates and is enthusiastic about mentoring the next generation of STEM professionals.
