Dr Marius Garmhausen is a principal data scientist in Personalised Healthcare (PHC) Analytics at Roche, Switzerland, where he focuses on integrating multi-modal data and applying machine learning methods to create a more complete understanding of individual patients' health status and their disease. Prior to this role, he worked for Roche Diagnostics where he applied machine learning methods to a broad variety of challenges, including liquid biopsy gene panel design, prediction of clinical trial success, drug repurposing or patient response prediction in oncology. Previously, Marius was trained as a software developer in the telecommunications industry but decided to change direction and follow his passion for biology. He holds a diploma in molecular biology and obtained his PhD in computational biology from the University of Cologne in 2017.
