Theo Damoulas is Professor of Machine Learning and Data Science with a joint appointment in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Warwick. He is also a Turing Fellow of The Alan Turing Institute and affiliated with NYU as an Exchange Assistant Professor at the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP). He holds a prestigious 5-year UKRI Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship on developing the machine learning foundations for digital twins.
Probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian statistics with an emphasis on the study and integration of various forms of structure and inductive biases (e.g. structured priors, spatiotemporal dependencies, dynamics, compositions, physical laws, flows, causality) while advancing robust and scalable approximate inference methodologies.
