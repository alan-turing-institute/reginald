“Deepfakes” or the use of AI to convincingly simulate or synthesise content, voice, images or video for malicious purposes (Nesta, 2018) , has become prominent recently, perhaps most obviously as a means to create realistic but fake pornography involving celebrities or particular victims .
As such,  there has already been some discussion regarding whether these “unreal” products constitute criminal material such as revenge porn ( better referred to as nonconsensual sharing of private or sexual images) or images of child sexual abuse ( “child pornography”) (Chesney and  Citron,2018) .
Its implications are however far greater. Techniques to generate deepfakes are evolving in response to a parallel arms war of detection techniques, and may eventually result in a world where the problems currently being experienced with “fake news” expand to everything we see, hear and experience , not just news we read. Obvious areas where this may impact on the law include the law of evidence: the law of intellectual property, primarily copyright: and fraudulent misrepresentation and anti-consumer scams: but these will only be the start of a deluge when our world of reality becomes inscrutably a constructed and manipulated text.
We suggest that pro-actively a number of governance approaches should be examined to try to forestall the impact of deepfakes on reality. These include;
Finally we consider in the light of work on transparency as to whether robots/ bots are persons  (EPSRC Principles of Robotics; California Senate Bill No 1001,  2018) if  a duty to certificate or separate reality from unreality or to filter unreality out, to the standard of comprehension of a reasonably perceptive person, should be imposed on service providers and platforms. Should the right to know what is real be a new human right?
