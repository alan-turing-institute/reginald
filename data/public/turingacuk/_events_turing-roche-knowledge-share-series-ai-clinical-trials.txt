This event will be on the theme of AI in Clinical Trials. We will explore how AI and machine learning methods can improve the efficiency of various aspects of a clinical trial such as the design, operations and analyses.
We'll be hearing from Nandini Chitale and Michael DAndrea, Data Scientists at Roche (Genentech) and Louise Coutts, Senior Research Associate at The Alan Turing Institute.
Nandini and Michael will be discussing recent work on evaluating machine learning for forecasting key clinical trial operational metrics. They will share how data-driven forecasts based on trial features such as procedures, eligibility criteria, and endpoints can be potentially useful for trial design and planning, which in turn can improve key outcomes related to patient recruitment and trial duration. 
Louise will be discussing the collaboration between the Turing and the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, where they are exploring the impact of statistical machine learning on the design, conduct and analysis of randomised clinical trials.
As well as having a Q&A at the event, we also hope to have discussions about this area pre and post the event via our Turing-Roche Slack Workspace which you can join.
