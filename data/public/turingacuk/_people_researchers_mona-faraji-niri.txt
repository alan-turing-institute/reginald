Mona Faraji Niri is a Senior Research Fellow at Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick. She has a PhD in modelling and control engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran. Mona’s main interests include modelling, control and optimisation of engineering and manufacturing systems. She has been endorsed by The Royal Academy of Engineering for her work in this filed as an exceptional promise. Her work has been published in Journal of Cleaner Production and IEEE Transactions of Intelligent Transportation Systems, among other journals.
Mona's research focuses on how modelling can support the optimised energy systems. She is particularly doing research in the field of renewable energy and energy storage systems and is expert with Li-ion batteries. She has developed models and control algorithms in order to optimise the performance of energy storage systems for electric transportation systems. She is working towards the optimisation of energy management, thermal management, and performance monitoring systems. She is also contributing to the advancement of battery manufacturing processes by introducing new AI and dynamic models as well as digital twins to increase the manufacturing transparency and predictability. Her research is inline with the Smart Manufacturing of energy storage systems for a clean and net-zero carbon future.
