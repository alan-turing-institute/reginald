Alain is a Lecturer within the Southampton School of Mathematical Sciences, where he is affiliated to CORMSIS - Centre for Operational Research, Management Science & Information Systems and the Operational Research Group. Prior to joining the University of Southampton, he was a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham and had previously worked as a Research Associate at the Technical University of Freiberg, where he also completed his PhD in Mathematics. He is Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, a Member of the EPSRC Mathematical Sciences Early Career Forum (2017 - 2019), a regular member of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS), and The Operational Research Society. 
Alain's research interests are in continuous optimization, with special focus on bilevel optimization and its applications to transportation, data analysis, forecasting, and phase retrieval. He has developed optimality conditions and stability/sensitivity analysis results for such problems and is currently developing numerical algorithms that can capture the optimistic and pessimistic features of bilevel optimization problems.
