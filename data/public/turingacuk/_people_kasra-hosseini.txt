Kasra is interested in (artificially) intelligent systems, machine learning, and data analysis and visualisation.
He completed his PhD in computational seismology at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University of Munich (LMU). During his PhD, he worked on the design and implementation of an algorithm ("No Data Left Behind") for seismic tomography inversions using large seismological datasets. After that, he worked as a postdoctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford from 2016-2019, where he focused on inverse theory, uncertainty estimation and interactive data visualisation.
Kasra was awarded the OxTALENT award for his work on interactive data visualisation, and he was awarded 1st prize by Earthscope in their “Visualising EarthScope Science: Motion” competition.
