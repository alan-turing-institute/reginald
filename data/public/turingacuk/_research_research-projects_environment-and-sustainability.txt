The effects of climate and environmental change constitute some of the most important challenges facing our society and quality, accessible, and reliable information across multiple scales, from global to molecular, is needed to understand the scale of these challenges and to develop strategies for mitigation and adaption.
Developing methods to provide the meaningful insight to inform decision-making, improve risk management and enhance our resilience to climate change will require working across disciplines, bringing together methodology and expertise from different fields to develop tools and computational frameworks that can integrate data from multiple sources, available at different spatial and temporal resolutions and with different biases and uncertainties.
The resulting frameworks will be applicable across a wide variety of applications, including integrating data from remote sensing satellites and traditional methods for ground observation with that from new sensor technologies; and integrating; integrating crop models, measurement data and climate projections to develop strategies for future agriculture; and understanding the threedimensional structure and dynamics of molecules.
This project is supported entirely by public funds, through Wave 1 of the UK Research and Innovation Strategic Priorities Fund, under EPSRC Grant EP/T001569/1.
 
The programme has a number of aims including:
The programme combines inter-disciplinary expertise, covering a variety of areas including data science, AI, agriculture, environmental science, policy, meteorology, and ecology, from across the Turing community and external partners. Partners in this work include British Antarctic Survey, Earlham Institute, Norwich Bioscience Park (John Innes Centre), Rothamsted Research, The Met Office & Joint Centre for Excellence in Environmental Intelligence, University of Cambridge, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and The Science and Technology Facilities Council.
The environment and sustainability programme currently consists of three projects:
Work in the environment and sustainability area addresses one of the defining crises of our time: the climate emergency. Developing robust and complex models integrating multiple datasets, real-time monitoring and data sources will enable enhanced decision making across a suit of policy areas. Sophisticated molecular modelling techniques will unlock more advanced and sustainable materials. Researchers will also be developing a toolbox of generalisable tools that will open the advances made to other areas of research, compounding the long-term potential impact of the work.
