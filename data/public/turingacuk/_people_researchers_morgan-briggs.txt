Trained as a data scientist, Morgan currently serves as the Research Associate for Data Science and Ethics within the Public Policy Programme. Morgan has experience leading cross-disciplinary teams and served in a project lead capacity at the Rhodes Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL) to assist the World Food Programme Innovation Accelerator with building AI solutions for urban food insecurity. Morgan has worked on a variety of topics related to social data science including food security and remote sensing, renewable energy, and ethical considerations of data science methodologies and digital technologies.
Morgan works on a variety of projects at the Turing including continued, ongoing work on AI explainability, building upon the Turing and ICO co-badged guidance, Explaining decisions made with AI. She is also a researcher on the UKRI-funded project called PATH-AI: Mapping an Intercultural Path to Privacy, Agency and Trust in Human-AI Ecosystems and an international project entitled Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice which is funded by grants from the Global Partnership on AI, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and BEIS. Morgan has continued to research topics related to children’s rights and AI stemming from research that was conducted with UNICEF. 
In addition to her role at the Turing, Morgan serves as an Associate Teaching Fellow for the Global Leadership Initiative, a programme created by the Oxford Character Project within the Faculty of Theology and Religion at the University of Oxford. Here, Morgan co-facilitates weekly sessions on topics of virtue ethics and character, as they relate to the technology sector. 
Morgan has a BSB from Wake Forest University where she studied Business Data Analytics and Religion. She also holds an MSc in Social Data Science from the University of Oxford, awarded with distinction.
