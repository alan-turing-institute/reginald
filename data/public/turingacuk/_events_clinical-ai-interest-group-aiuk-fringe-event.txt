There is increasing excitement at the potential beneficial utility of artificial intelligence in clinical practice. Indeed, there are already examples of AI-computer vision applications assisting in clinical radiology, AI-enhanced sleep applications and AI-driven drug discovery being deployed in the health sphere.

The Alan Turing Institute Clinical AI Interest Group was launched in May 2022 and brings together over 250 health professionals and data scientists to connect, keep up-to-date with developments in the field of data science and AI, and enable research and application across health domains.
We welcome you to join our first hybrid event to meet, connect and formally launch the Supra-Clinical AI Groups. These groups are focused on specialist interests in the particular clinical fields of Medical imaging and Computer Vision, Neurology and Mental Health and Anaesthetics and Intensive Care.
You will hear from the leads of the Supra-interest groups, about our plans for the Clinical AI Summer School as well as it being a welcome opportunity to meet the wider community.
Our keynote will be given by Alastair Denniston, Consultant Ophthalmologist (Uveitis and Medical Retina), University Hospitals Birmingham NHSFT & Honorary Professor, University of Birmingham, UK.
His talk will be about 'Ensuring AI in health is safe, effective and equitable’.
This event is hybrid. The event location is The Alan Turing Institute, Enigma room, although you will also be able to join online using zoom link sent to you once you register.
Our agenda will be:
