Max Welling is a Distinguished Scientist within Microsoft Research (MSR) AI4Science, based in Amsterdam. He finished his PhD in theoretical high energy physics under the supervision of Nobel laureate Gerard ‘t Hooft. Max is also a Professor and Research Chair in Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam where he directs the research group AMLAB. He is a fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) where he serves on the founding board. His previous appointments include VP at Qualcomm Technologies, Professor at UC Irvine, postdoc at University of Toronto and UCL under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton and postdoc at Caltech under the supervision of Pietro Perona. 
Max has served as Associate Editor in Chief of IEEE TPAMI from 2011-2015. Since 2015, Max has served on the advisory board of the NeurIPS foundation. Additionally, he has been Program Chair and General Chair of NeurIPS in 2013 and 2014 respectively. He was Program Chair of AISTATS in 2009, ECCV in 2016 and General Chair and Co-Founder of MIDL 2018.
Max was the recipient of the ECCV Koenderink Prize in 2010 and the ICML Test of Time award in 2021. Max is co-author of a number of influential papers that introduced Variational Autoencoders, Graph Neural Networks and Equivariant Neural Networks into the machine learning community.
