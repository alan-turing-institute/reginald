What do you get if you combine top academics, contentious research and a comedian compère? Answer: the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas (CoDI)!
As part of London Data Week, we're bringing CoDI to The Camden Club for a night of edgy, exciting AI and data science-based entertainment with a comedy twist.
Doors open at 19:00 for a 19:30 start. Adult content, suitable for 18+.
Hosted by comedian Susan Morrison, and now in its eleventh year, CoDI is ninety minutes of rapid-fire research from some of the finest minds in the country. In this London special, Turing researchers will take to the stage to challenge ideas around AI, data science and technology. From AI in the justice system to conspiracy theories and beyond, this show is one not to miss.
Wake up Sheeple: Unraveling the Sock Matrix - Anna George
Attention truth seekers! Leave the herd and explore the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories. Prepare for revelations about the infamous flat Earth, climate change, and sock thieves. Get ready for science, laughter, and the secret whereabouts of your lost socks.
The algorithm will sentence you now! - Cari Hyde-Vaamonde
Is replacing judges with AI a horrifying prospect? Could algorithms have more impartiality than judges? Cari Hyde-Vaamonde explores whether technology could help make better decisions and laws for our justice system.
Feeling the AI fear? - Michael Katell
ChatGPT is coming for our jobs! AI faked Drake! Well, there’s good news: The bad news is not what you think it is. The fear is by design. It’s the point!
