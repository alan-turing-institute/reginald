Bastian is a Senior Researcher in the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme where he works on implementing participatory citizen science approaches across different projects. As a great fan of open science and participatory approaches, he believes that including those affected into the research process not only improves data ethics and data justice aspects, but also leads to better and more applied research outcomes.
Bastian has a background in biology and received a PhD in Bioinformatics from the University of Frankfurt, Germany. Since then he has been working on different participatory data science efforts. He was a research fellow at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris where he led a research group on facilitating participatory medicine approaches prior to joining the Turing.
 
Bastian is working on the open source Citizen Science platform.
