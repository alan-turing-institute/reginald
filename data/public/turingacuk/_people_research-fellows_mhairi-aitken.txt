Mhairi Aitken is an Ethics Fellow in the Public Policy Programme at The Alan Turing Institute, and an Honorary Senior Fellow at Australian Centre for Health Engagement, Evidence and Values (ACHEEV) at the University of Wollongong in Australia. She is a Sociologist whose research examines social and ethical dimensions of digital innovation particularly relating to uses of data and AI. Mhairi has a particular interest in the role of public engagement in informing ethical data practices.
Mhairi was included in the 2023 international list of “100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics”.
Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, Mhairi was a Senior Research Associate at Newcastle University where she worked principally on an EPSRC-funded project exploring the role of machine learning in banking. Between 2009 and 2018 Mhairi was a Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh where she undertook a programme of research and public engagement to explore social and ethical dimensions of data-intensive health research. She held roles as a Public Engagement Research Fellow in both the Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research and the Scottish Health Informatics Programme (SHIP).
Mhairi is passionate about finding creative ways of engaging members of the public in discussions around the roles of data and AI in society. She is a regular performer in the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and has performed shows based on her research at the Edinburgh International Science Festival, Glasgow International Comedy Festival, Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival as well as in stand-up comedy clubs.
Mhairi is a frequent contributor to media discussions on AI and data, including on TV, radio and in print. She has featured on BBC 2 Politics Live, BBC Radio 4 Today Programme and Woman’s Hour, LBC with Andrew Marr, BBC Five Live and many more radio programmes across national and regional stations. She featured as an on screen expert in Shark Teeth Films’ six part documentary series “Secrets of Big Data”.
Mhairi’s recent invited lectures, talks, and public appearances include:
Mhairi’s research draws on her background in Sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine social and ethical dimensions of innovation. Her current research includes a focus on developing child-centred approaches to AI and advancing data justice. Her past research has focussed in particular on the role of machine learning in finance; governance of data-intensive health research; ethical considerations around secondary uses of health data and; planning and development processes relating to renewable energy projects.
Mhairi has experience of using a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods and has a particular interest in deliberative engagement methods including citizens' juries, deliberative workshops, focus groups and public panels.
