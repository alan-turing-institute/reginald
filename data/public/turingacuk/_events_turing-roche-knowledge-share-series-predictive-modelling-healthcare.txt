An event series for Turing-Roche partnership updates, knowledge sharing and new perspectives. Find out more about the series.
This event will be exploring the topic of predictive modelling in healthcare- how this branch of advanced analytics can potentially predict and help improve patient outcomes and beyond.
We'll be hearing from four speakers:
Dr Jasmina Bogojeska, Senior Principal Data Scientist at Roche Diagnostics – will be talking about Navify Kidney Companion, which focuses on the challenging problem of early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease patients with fast progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD). The tool allows for timely intervention and thus has the potential to delay or even prevent the development of ESRD.
Dr Matthew Sperrin, Senior Lecturer in Health Data Science at the University of Manchester – will be talking about the role of causal inference in predictive modelling
Dr Elif Ozkirimli, Head of Data Science and Advanced Analytics – Pharma International Data and Analytics Chapter at Roche- will be talking about using real world data for cardiac safety modeling
Dr Brieuc Lehmann, Assistant Professor at University College London (UCL) – will be talking to us about improving local prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections using a casual debiasing framework.
As well as having a Q&A at the event, we hope to have discussions about this area pre and post the event via our Turing-Roche Slack Workspace.
