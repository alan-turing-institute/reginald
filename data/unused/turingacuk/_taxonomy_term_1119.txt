The Turing Lectures series features influential figures from the dynamic world of data science and artificial intelligence. These prestigious, landmark lectures lead and shape the national conversation, sparking debate, informing and, of course, entertaining audiences.
Our thought-leaders are renowned experts – often world authorities – each with their unique perspectives. From scientific advisors to high-profile scientists, entrepreneurs, industry insiders, and leading academics, The Turing Lectures prides itself on diversity, and authoritative and an engaging style.
Speaking to packed audiences, the lectures have already included the lead scientist of Google Deepmind’s Machine Learning team, Nando de Freitas; Buzzfeed News Editor, Craig Silverman; computer scientist, academic and social entrepreneur Sue Black OBE; and mathematician, author and broadcaster, Hannah Fry. 
Topics explored in the series are as diverse as the speakers and reflect a rapidly changing world. With subjects as intriguing as the ethical implications of 'deepfakes', AI’s effect on economics and the commercial sector, data trusts, the opportunity of the digital humanities, and the promise of wearable tech.
The reach of The Turing Lectures series goes well beyond its highly engaged live audience and you can discover or rediscover many of our lectures via our YouTube channel. The series continues to grow in scope, ambition and reputation and we look forward to welcoming you.
