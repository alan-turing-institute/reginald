The Alan Turing Institute is pleased to host the official launch of the AI Standards Hub – the UK’s new initiative dedicated to knowledge sharing, community building, strategic research, and international engagement around standardisation for AI technologies.
The initiative is led by the Alan Turing Institute in partnership with the British Standards Institution (BSI), the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and supported by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Office for AI. 
We invite you to participate in the event online.

 
The event will take place on Wednesday 12 October, 11:00 - 15:45 and will be a hybrid event, with open online participation with Q&A. 
The sessions will feature presentations and interactive discussions with senior government representatives, the Hub’s partner organisations, and key stakeholders.
