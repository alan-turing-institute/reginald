Dr. Gobe Hobona is the Director of Knowledge Management for the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The OGC is an international industry consortium of over 525 companies, government agencies and universities participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available interface standards for geospatial technologies. Gobe is responsible for the OGC’s knowledge management strategy towards creating an environment that enables the OGC membership to identify, create, represent, share, distribute, and adopt insights and experiences across programmes. His other roles within the OGC include being Chair of the OGC Naming Authority and the OGC Architecture Domain Working Group. Prior to joining OGC staff, he was the Consultancy Team Leader and Head of Applied Research at Envitia. During his time at Envitia, he was the technical lead of a multi-year geospatial research project sponsored by a major UK government ministry. He has also previously held postdoctoral research posts at Newcastle University and the University of Nottingham. He is a professional member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).
