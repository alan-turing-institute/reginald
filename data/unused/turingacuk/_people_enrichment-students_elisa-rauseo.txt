Elisa Rauseo is a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Cardiovascular Medicine at the William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, and an Honorary Clinical Fellow in Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging at Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust.
Coming from a clinical background and with skills in data science, she works at the interface of artificial intelligence and healthcare, bringing deep clinical knowledge and machine learning algorithms together to advance cardiovascular disease research.
Her doctoral project aims to use machine learning methods combining clinical data and established and novel cardiac imaging metrics to improve the characterisation and outcomes prediction of heterogeneous cardiovascular conditions. The ultimate goal of her research is to identify distinct risk profiles for disease progression to guide clinical decision-making, generate precision medicine solutions customised to individual characteristics, and improve clinical outcomes.
