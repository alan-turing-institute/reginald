In-person tickets are now sold out. You can still secure your place at AI UK through the live stream and watch the showcase, which will host over 150 expert speakers from multi-disciplinary backgrounds, across three stages: conversation, research and impact.
Listen along to dynamic sessions outlining the latest research and innovation in data science and AI, including lightning talks, or panel sessions on exploring the latest research and technology being applied to everyday societal challenges. Live streaming AI UK means the flexibility to design your agenda around existing commitments.
Artificial intelligence (AI) can help make decisions and processes in your organisation both faster and simpler in a surprising number of efficient ways. Machine learning and data science are being used at every level to give organisations, charities, councils and other public and third sector bodies a cutting-edge advantage; but ethical use is paramount.
At AI UK 2023, you’ll be surrounded by the best and brightest in today’s AI ecosystem, who’ll be demonstrating the latest ethical data science innovations, giving talks on their cutting-edge inclusive research, running workshops, and forging partnerships.
It is a truly exciting time for the UK’s AI landscape and 2023 will be the very first time the event has been held in person. That means that not only do you have access to our packed agenda of innovative sessions and lightning talks led by trailblazing minds and innovators, but you can also get to know them – as well as catch up with your own sector peers – at the showcase’s networking events. What’s more, you’ll be able to dip into a great variety of live, interactive applied AI technologies in action through our demonstrations; hear the development and implementation stories from the minds behind and tech, and learn from and be inspired by their stories.
With previous speakers including Sir Patrick Vallance and Chris Philp, AI UK will provide a unique platform where prominent figures from government and local councils will meet world-leading academics. On stage,
in the exhibition arena and, more intimately, at the various roundtable sessions throughout the showcase, there will be curated opportunities to discuss how pioneering research can be implemented in regions across the UK and beyond.
AI UK is the place to learn about the latest developments in machine learning, data science and AI. The two-day showcase features a programme of industry-leading speakers, cutting-edge updates, stimulating discussions and debates, and bite-sized lightning talks, as well interactive demonstrations of state-of-the-art tech innovation in action.
At AI UK, you’ll find myriad ways to answer all your AI questions – as well as to pose those big questions yourself. How is AI changing the way the public sector thinks about and plans for the future? How can collaborations between researchers and charities lead to practicable, real-world solutions? What should councils and local government do to help narrow the skills gap faced by the UK’s AI ecosystem?
Dedicated networking spaces and sessions at AI UK mean that you can meet colleagues, peers and others interested in what AI can achieve for their organisations and constituents – and discuss ways in which to collaborate and make that happen. Connect over coffee or lunch or meet at a lightning talk; there will be plenty of opportunities to engage with leading minds to take your innovative thinking to the next level.
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
