Data Study Group (DSG) are collaborative events bringing together skilled data scientists with Challenge Owners (CO) to tackle everyday business challenges. Principal Investigators (PI) are a dedicated resource to COs, working alongside them to determine the scope of the challenge, define the research questions, and understand the nature of the proposed data set to ensure it is ready for the DSG event. 
There are too many COs that need dedicated academic support to prepare their challenge for a DSG than what the DSG team core can provide. This is a good opportunity for training early career researchers in preparation for overseeing future projects, especially when working with industry. 
A PI will be sourced shortly after Turing partnership development confirms the project is nominally viable for a DSG project. This should have a minimum of two months of preparation time for the scoping and following the DSG event itself, two months for results preparation. 
You can also sign up to our DSG PI mailing list to be notified of our latest opportunities below. Please see more info in our resources section below.

Will be based on your CV and cover letter for selection to interview.
The cover letter (up to two pages) should demonstrate your ability to suggest multiple potential methodological approaches to the challenge being applied for, as well as demonstrate:

You can download the full guide to being a DSG PI here. It includes detail on the lifecycle of a challenge, PI responsibilities, data suitability and more FAQs.
 

“Being a DSG PI was a great experience, because it enabled me to partake in one of the most fun activities as a data scientist - serving as a translator between people of different disciplines and backgrounds.
Additionally, this experience has sparked future collaborations with DSTL.
I have two suggestions for future DSP PIs: Firstly, I think that it is very important to meet with the challenge owner one-on-one as early as possible before the DSG in order to help ‘translate’ their questions into the language of data science and help manage expectations.
Secondly, it is helpful to make sure that the data is in a format that would enable DSG participants to jump into data analysis straight away, instead of wasting precious time parsing strange data formats or reformatting tables.
Being a DSG PI is very rewarding, especially seeing all of the innovative ideas that DSG participants come up with!”
