Keri Grieman is a lawyer qualified in Ontario, Canada. She holds a Bachelor of Arts and a Juris Doctorate from the University of Calgary, and a Master of Laws from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), where she received the Computer and Communications Law prize. Following her Master of Laws, Keri was the Google Policy Fellow at the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic. Keri is currently undertaking a PhD studentship at The Alan Turing Institute in partnership with QMUL, supervised by Professor Chris Reed and Dr Laura Edgar. 
During her Masters program, Keri was supervised by Professor Chris Reed, who encouraged her interest in the regulation of emerging technologies. This led to Keri’s desire to engage in interdisciplinary collaboration in order to better structure technological regulation. Keri is excited to engage with The Alan Turing Institute as a wonderful cross-section of artificial intelligence and data science projects, collaborative deep investigation, and public-oriented works. Keri hopes to learn from a variety of Turing projects, particularly those in automated transit and artificial intelligence in medicine, in order to foster an aligned relationship between the creation of new technologies and their regulation. 
Keri is a technology-law focused researcher interested in the regulation of emerging technologies. Keri’s research areas include regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly automated transport and medical applications; privacy and data collection; smart cities; and interactive entertainment. 
In her Master of Laws, Keri focused on the allocation of liability for self-driving vehicles, and her dissertation was later published by the Journal of Intellectual Property, Information Technology and Electronic Commerce Law.* In her position as the Google Policy Fellow at the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, Keri collaborated on developing recommendations on a privacy code of conduct for smart cities as part of the Smart City Privacy Project. Keri is also a Certified Information Privacy Professional, as designated by the International Association of Privacy Professionals.
In her PhD, Keri worked on the regulation of AI causing accidental death. While the technological advancement in AI has lead to a bevy of exciting potential applications such as self-driving vehicles, the regulation of such technologies has not yet caught up. Important questions to be answered include who or what to regulate, when to regulate, and how to regulate. Keri is grateful for the opportunity to work with the Turing’s researchers in order to glean insight into the AI process in areas such as transportation and medicine.
