Urban-regional planning, urban modelling and simulations, spatial analysis and visualisation. Her PhD and current work focuses on the integration of urban modelling and analytics in proceduraly generated 3D cities, for the development of online “what-if” scenarios for planning and participation.
Other research areas include remote sensing, virtual & augmented reality, IoT, as well as creative technology and interactive installations for exhibitions.
She is involved in the award winning projects “Remap Lima” for participatory mapping projects with drones, in collaboration with DPU and CASA in UCL and a network of 49 organisations from Lima, Peru; the "Little Sparks Hospital", coordinating and developing VR applications for children undergoing surgery in collaboration with NHS; as well as the CASA "Drones4Good" workshop for young people in collaboration with UCL Engineering.
Her visualisation work has been featured in several mainstream media, such as the Guardian, Fast Company, Urbanista and Archdaily.
