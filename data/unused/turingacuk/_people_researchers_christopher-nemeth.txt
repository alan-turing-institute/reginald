Dr Chris Nemeth is a senior lecturer in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Lancaster University. He is interested in problems pertaining to Bayesian machine learning and computational statistics, with a particular focus on Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo techniques. His current research is focused on Bayesian methods for large-scale datasets and tools for online learning. He also works on problems related to Gaussian processes and network modelling. Chris currently holds a UKRI-EPSRC Turing AI Fellowship on Probabilistic Algorithms for Scalable and Computable Approaches to Learning (PASCAL) and formerly an EPSRC Innovation Fellowship on Scalable and Exact Data Science for Security and Location-based Data. Chris is currently the chair of the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning section of the Royal Statistical Society and Associate Editor for the Data-Centric Engineering journal.
