The programme management team drives forward the strategic direction of the programme and manages the operation of the programme, its projects and its partnerships on a day-to-day basis.

The Advisory Board, made up of foremost academics, provides independent advice on the strategic direction of the programme, helping to ensure that it is meeting societal and sector needs and working towards achieving the highest levels of real-world impact.
The Grand Challenge and Strategic Leaders are all senior academics, each leading on the implementation of projects to meet the overarching challenges and strategic foci of the programme, which have been selected to ensure the programme delivers the greatest impact.
The programme has adopted a ‘Group Leader’ structure, in which established and rising academics are appointed to lead teams of researchers undertaking foundational research in specific engineering and data-science areas.
The Group Leaders are also tasked with attracting new funding to the emerging field, establishing wider scientific collaborations and engaging with industry and policymakers to translate research into practice.
This 'open engagement’ approach is central to the programme's aim to achieve a broad and solid foundational base for data-centric engineering research and practice.
The programme also engages with a wide number of academics at all levels and works with partners across industry, government and the third sector.
