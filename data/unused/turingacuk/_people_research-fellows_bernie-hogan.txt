Bernie Hogan completed his BA(hons) at the Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, where he received the University Medal in Sociology. Since then he has been working on Internet use and social networks at the University of Toronto under social network analysis pioneer Barry Wellman. Bernie received his Masters of Arts at Toronto in 2003, and defended his PhD Dissertation in the Fall of 2008. His dissertation examines how the use of ICTs alters the way people maintain their relationships in everyday life. In 2005 he was an intern at Microsoft’s Community Technologies Lab, working with Danyel Fisher on new models for email management. 
Bernie Hogan’s research focuses on the creation, maintenance and analysis of personal social networks, with a particular focus on the relation between online and offline networks. Hogan’s work has demonstrated the utility of visualisation for network members, how the addition of new social media can complicate communication strategies, and how the uneven distribution of media globally can affect the ability of people to participate online. Currently, Hogan is working on techniques to simplify the deployment of personal network studies for newcomers as well as social-theoretical work on the relationship between naming conventions and identities.
