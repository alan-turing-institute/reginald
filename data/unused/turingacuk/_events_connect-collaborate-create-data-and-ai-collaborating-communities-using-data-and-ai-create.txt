A family-friendly free event opens to all at the Bristol Beacon on 8th June, inviting the public to join the conversation around Chat GPT, protecting vulnerable communities, and creating a sustainable future.  
Find out more and book your free space via The University of Bristol website.
This event is part of the #Bristol Data Week 2023 schedule of free activities.
Data is all around us, from our smartphones to our supermarkets, but how can we use it for good?
How do we use ChatGPT and AI to create a fairer future for all?
How can data from the past shape our future? 
Join the Jean Golding Institute and the University of the West of England to Connect, Collaborate, Create with Data and AI. Join the conversation with engaging scientists and local representatives to discover how communities could use data and AI like ChatGPT to tackle key issues including inclusivity, protecting the vulnerable, and climate change. Hear about the latest advances in Data-intensive research, and Artificial Intelligence, with inspiring speakers and interactive exhibitions. Meet speakers and mingle with guests during a complimentary lunch or sign up to one of the inclusive data workshops. There will be many opportunities to network, socialise and interact with the Bristol data and AI community.
