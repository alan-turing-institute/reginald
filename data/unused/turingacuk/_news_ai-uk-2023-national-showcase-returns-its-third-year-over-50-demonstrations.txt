AI UK 2023, the national showcase of data science and AI, will feature over 50 innovative demonstrations from world-leading institutions across the UK. These will showcase research applications for the environment, healthcare, digital twins and smart cities – as well as many others.  
This year’s event is themed around the Office for Science and Technology’s key priorities which include: the sustainable environment; health and life sciences; national security and defence, including space; and a digitally and data driven economy and an open call for the showcase resulted in a huge response. 
A digital twin of the vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough showing how AI can reduce carbon in polar navigation, a tool monitoring and predicting sea ice forecasts, and new AI automated monitoring tool for moths are just some of the demonstrations that will explore environmental challenges. 
Demonstrations on the theme of healthcare include a tool that can automatically locate the outlines of bones in X-rays, a prototype of a new companion robot and a live showing of AI-tool that can help radiologists detect ovarian cancer. 
A tool for designing low-traffic neighbourhoods that can be used to suggest changes to our streets and a project aiming to improve cycling safety on the roads will use VR headsets to help users experience scenarios through the lens of the rider, both consider how to improve the cities we live in. 
Other topical issues that will be explored include a data-film created using analysis of 5 million NFTs to explore the NFT phenomenon, a 3D shoe sketcher that will revolutionise how we shop online and the launch of ‘The Blame Game’ which aims to engage the public in a discussion on how blame should be attributed in a hybrid world of humans and machines. 
Delegates attending the showcase will also hear the latest thinking from leading academics, policymakers and industry leaders in fields ranging from digital twins, the environment and AI ethics. 
The event will feature three main stages (conversation, research and impact), lightning talks, a workshop area and the exhibition space, which will feature interactive demonstrations. 
Secure your place online now for the two-day event which will take place on 21-22 March at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in Westminster, London. Early bird tickets are available until Monday 23 January. 
Chief Scientist of The Alan Turing Institute, Mark Girolami said: “We’re pleased to start 2023 with the launch of our national showcase, AI UK. We look forward to building on the success of last year’s event by welcoming some of the UK’s leading voices to help us show the innovative AI, machine learning and data science research and innovation taking place across the UK.  
"With lively, interactive content, world-leading experts, and immersive demonstrations, the event will explore how AI can help us face some of the most important issues facing society today.”
