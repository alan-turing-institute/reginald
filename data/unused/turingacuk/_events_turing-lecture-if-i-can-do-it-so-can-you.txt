“If I can do it, so can you” is the inspiring and motivating story of one woman’s determination to succeed. 25 years ago, Dr Sue Black was a single parent with three small children living on a council estate in Brixton. She is now one of the top 50 women in tech in Europe, received an OBE and just been appointed to the Government Advisory body shaping digital services. Sue talks about how she brought her family out of poverty and built a successful career through education, passion and a determination to succeed.
#TuringLecture #YouCanToo

The Alan Turing Institute is delighted to present this special event in Newcastle, with Sue Black OBE and #techmums, a social enterprise that teaches mothers technology skills and builds their confidence, encouraging them into education, entrepreneurship and employment.
Sue Black is a Technology Evangelist and Digital Skills Expert. She was awarded an OBE for ‘Service to technology’ in the 2016 Queen’s New Year’s Honours List and will share the motivational story about how she rose from humble beginnings through sheer determination. She is known not only for being an award-winning computer scientist and UK government adviser, but also as an activist and passionate social entrepeneuer. She led the campaign to save Bletchley Park 2008-2011 and today continues to help support women find their way in these tech-driven times - from learning how to access universal credit online to coding entire websites. 
The event will begin with lunch, before Sue shares her story, and will be followed by an optional beginners workshop in app design, with all levels welcome (no prior experience necessary). 
If you require any support in getting to us, from childcare to transport costs, please email [email protected] or call Jessie on 07961 479 488, to apply for funding.
