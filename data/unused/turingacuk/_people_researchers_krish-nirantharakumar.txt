Krish is the theme lead for health informatics and Professor in Health Data Science and Public Health at the Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham. Krish’s research interest spans across methodology development in epidemiology to clinical research in diabetes, endocrinology and multimorbidity.
Krish’s unique innovative methodological programme of work, known as “Automated Clinical Epidemiology Studies (ACES)”, has led to the University of Birmingham gaining an international reputation for being one of the few universities globally to have successfully researched and knowledge-engineered epidemiological study designs into computer executable formats. University of Birmingham was the first to implement such a platform in the United Kingdom and publish the methods in a peer-reviewed epidemiology journal. 
The software within the ACES platform, named DExtER (Data Extraction for Epidemiological Research) has resulted in more than 60 peer-reviewed original research publications and has raised over 15 million pounds worth of research funding in the last 3 years. The DExtER tool is now being trialled as a data driven clinical trials platform (RADIANT trial with CEGEDIM funded by NIHR). Krish’s team also emulate clinical trials rapidly, with one such study informing the largest data driven clinical trial to be funded by the National Institute for Health Research (DaRe2THINK), in which Krish is a co-investigator and the team lead for data co-ordination and management. Krish’s team have demonstrated use of the ACES platform to answer clinical questions that arise during patient consultations within hours (Informatics Consult). Following this piece of work Krish (Joint Principal Investigator) and colleagues have obtained a grant from NIHR to develop an AI driven advanced patient similarity tool (OPTIMAL) to improve care for people with multiple long term conditions. 
Building on the success of the ACES platform Krish has established six clinical specialty-specific “Real World Evidence” research groups, focussing on diabetes and endocrinology (led by Krish), gastroenterology, ophthalmology, nephrology, women’s health (led by Krish) and mental health. These research groups have contributed to over 25 publications, many in high impact general medical and specialty journals. The ACES platform will also support the growth of small and medium industries by rapidly generating preliminary health intelligence as part of the recently funded DEMAND hub. As a result of Krish’s expertise in clinical informatics, he was invited to be part of the prestigious methodology panel of the Medical Research Council (MRC).
Krish’s clinical research interest is focussed on diabetes, endocrinology and multimorbidity. He leads the clinical epidemiology group at the centre for endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism (CEDAM). He has published his research in high impact general medical journals such as BMJ and PLOS Medicine and high ranking specialist journals such as Diabetes Care (DC) for diabetes and Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM) for endocrinology.
He has been an expert panel member to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline committees focussing on diabetes and have been invited through a competitive process to be part of the clinical advisory group for acute care at Diabetes UK in recognition of his outstanding track record on in-patient diabetes research. He is currently leading the health needs assessment for people with diabetes in the West Midlands on behalf of the West Midlands Clinical Research Network. In addition to his interest in diabetes and endocrinology research Krish also has an interest in multimorbidity research. Krish leads two multimorbidity consortiums one focussing on multimorbidity in pregnancy (MuMPreDiCT: Principal Investigator) and another focussing on using artificial intelligence to improve care for people with complex multimorbidity (OPTIMAL: Joint Principal Investigator). He is also a co-investigator of the BIRM-CAM grant, developing innovative clustering methods to research multimorbidity and MurMur, a project to conceptualise multimorbidity and to establish multimorbidity cohorts.
