Darren Wilkinson is Professor (Statistics) at Durham University. He studied at Durham University, where he did a degree in Mathematics followed by a PhD in Bayesian Statistics. After a year as a research associate at Durham, he took up a Lectureship at Newcastle, being promoted to Professor in 2007. He began working on problems in statistical bioinformatics and computational systems biology shortly after moving to Newcastle. From 2008-2011 he held a BBSRC Research Development Fellowship to study stochasticity and heterogeneity in model biological systems.
He continues to be motivated by challenging inferential problems arising from life science research, and is active in the biological sciences research community, currently serving on BBSRC's Strategy Advisory Panel for Enabling New Ways of Working. In addition to being an investigator on several large RCUK grants, he currently co-directs Newcastle's EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Cloud Computing for Big Data, building on his existing interests in modelling large and complex data sets in molecular biology and genomics.
His current research interests involve applications of Bayesian statistics to a variety of challenging big data problems in molecular biology and engineering. He is especially interested in parameter inference for dynamic models, on-line inference for high-velocity time series data, probabilistic programming, and the use of approximate models and emulators for rendering computationally prohibitive algorithms for expensive models more tractable.
