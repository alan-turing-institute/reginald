Dr Janis Wong is a Postdoctoral Research Associate on the Ethics theme of the Public Policy Programme. She has an interdisciplinary PhD in Computer Science from the Centre for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy (CRISP), University of St Andrews, where her PhD thesis on co-creating data protection solutions through a commons was awarded the Stefano Rodotà Award by the Council of Europe for best data protection thesis. She also holds an MSc in Computing and Information Technology from the University of St Andrews and an LLB Bachelor of Laws from the London School of Economics.
Janis is interested in the legal and technological applications in data protection, ethics, governance, and stewardship. In 2020-21, Janis was a Research Fellow at the Open Data Institute, focusing on data protection and governance in online teaching, learning analytics, and educational technology. In addition to working with universities and the public sector, she is a frequent expert contributor to public media and works closely with private sector organisations to turn theory into practice. She currently sits on the Data Ethics Steering Group as part of The RED Foundation to apply data ethics practices into the real estate sector.
Janis' research focuses on data protection, stewardship, and governance as it relates to artificial intelligence, ethics, and public policy. She draws on her expertise in data protection and information regulations, data stewardship and data governance, human-computer interaction (HCI), and science and technology studies (STS) to address power imbalances and stakeholder tensions when designing, building, and deploying innovative technologies.
Janis uses both quantitative and qualitative methodologies in her research, where her past research includes topics such as data protection rights, privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), online learning and educational technologies, the impact of social media on the physical and mental health of young people, research ethics frameworks, and collaborative design.
Janis was awarded the Stefano Rodotà Award 2023 from the Council of Europe Committee of Convention 108, with her PhD thesis on data protection awarded first place and an invitation to present her work at the Committee of Convention 108 Plenary in Strasbourg.
Janis is an active speaker and enjoys communicating artificial intelligence, ethics, and privacy-related topics to both academic and non-academic audiences.
