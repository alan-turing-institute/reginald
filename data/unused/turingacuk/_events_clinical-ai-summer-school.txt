This is a one day training event for Clinicians with little or no expertise in artificial intelligence (AI).
It is organised by the Clinical AI Interest Group
In the morning, we will have AI experts teaching you about the basic concepts of AI and Machine Learning, giving an overview of the ethical considerations when using AI responsibly and discussing the quality, standards, and regulation considerations needed for developing and deploying AI in a clinical setting.  
In the afternoon, we will hear about the state of health AI deployment and then we will go on to have a hand-on session that will give you experience of using AI to diagnose cancer from images. 
The event is in person only and is being held in the Enigma Room of The Alan Turing Institute. 
The address is British Library, 96 Euston Road, London NW1 2DB, London, UK.
