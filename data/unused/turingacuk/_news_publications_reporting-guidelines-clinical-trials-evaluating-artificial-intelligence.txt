As artificial intelligence moves into the realm of clinical trials, consideration is needed on whether the current CONSORT and SPIRIT reporting statements are sufficient to ensure transparency. This commentary describes work by an international group of researchers who form the CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI Steering Group to develop new reporting guidelines for AI-driven interventions in clinical trials.
