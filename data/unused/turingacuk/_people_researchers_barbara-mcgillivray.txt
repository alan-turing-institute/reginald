Hi! I grew up in the beautiful city of Florence in Italy, and I have Scottish origins. I am Turing Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute, senior research associate the University of Cambridge and Editor in Chief of the Journal of Open Humanities Data. In September 2021 I will start as lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London.
I have always been passionate about how the sciences and the humanities can meet. I completed a PhD in Computational Linguistics from the University of Pisa in 2010 after a degree in Mathematics and one in Classics from the University of Florence (Italy). Before joining the Turing, I was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature.
Check out my Turing research spotlight interview here and my interview for Cambridge Language Sciences.
You can follow me on Twitter here.
Language changes all the time in fascinating ways. My research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. I work on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). My interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic. 
My research was featured in the Christmas 2020 edition of the Economist "How data analysis can enrich the liberal arts". My research on emoji semantic change was featured in the New Scientist and BBC.
Check out my interview for the Economist's podcast in December 2020 and my interview with Dennis Relojo-Howell (January 2021).
I have founded and convene the Data Science and Digital Humanities Special Interest Group at the Turing.
