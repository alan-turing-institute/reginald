Georgia is a health data science doctoral student registered with the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics at the University of Leeds. Her main interests are within the fields of epidemiology and causal inference methods.
Her background includes a BSc in Nutrition from the University of Leeds, followed by an MSc in Health Data Analytics during which she was introduced to causal inference methods and developed a keen interest in this area. As part of this, she co-leads the Causal Inference Interest Group at the Institute and has significant experience in teaching causal inference methods to health and social scientists of all career levels.
Georgia's research interests are largely focused on the use of causal inference methods in health and medical research. More specifically, they include:
1. Understanding causal effects in nutritional epidemiology involving compositional data. This is the predominant focus of Georgia's doctoral research. Using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and simulations, she examines the challenges surrounding strategies for energy intake adjustment and substitution modelling through the lens of causal inference. Her research in this area has attracted considerable international interest.
2. Exploring the challenges in the analyses of composite variables and compositional data in health research. Georgia is interested in the problems that arise when estimating causal effects involving composite variables and compositional data. This includes considering how to depict such variables within DAGs, considering the corresponding causal estimands, and planning the appropriate causal analyses.
