Dr Erin Lorelie Young is a Research Fellow in the Public Policy programme. She has a Ph.D. (D.Phil) from the University of Oxford, where she studied the socio-technical practices of interdisciplinary research and development projects building new technologies. Prior to joining the Turing, Erin was an H-STAR Visiting Researcher at Stanford University, and a Researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, working on various projects including investigating the potential of AI for lifelong learning.
Erin has also held positions as a Consultant at the United Nations (IIEP-UNESCO) in Paris, Kantar in London, and Thomson Reuters in New York City. She has a PGC in International Business Administration and Practice and Organisational Behaviour, and earned scholarships to study at the British Schools of Athens and Rome. She holds an MSc (Distinction) from the University of Oxford in Education (Learning and Technology), and an MA in Classics from the University of Cambridge.

Erin is interested in the social, economic and governance-related implications of technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and other data-driven innovations. Her work sits at the intersection of technology and society, drawing from Science and Technology Studies (STS), in particular Actor-Network Theory (ANT), organisational sociology and mixed methods research, exploring responsible and ethical AI design, social data science for policy-making, information science, and data governance and technological innovation across sectors.
