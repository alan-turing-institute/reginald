King’s College London’s Department of Digital Humanities, together with The National Archives UK, the Digital Curation Innovation Center at the University of Maryland iSchool, and the Maryland State Archives in the US, were awarded an Arts and Humanities Research Council one-year International Research Networking grant for UK-US Collaborations in Digital Scholarship in Cultural Institutions, running from 1 February 2019 to 31 January 2020. 
The AHRC-funded CAS Network addresses the application of computational methods to the contextualisation of records within archival collections, at a time when the archive is becoming an increasingly digital space. Though a series of events held in both the US and the UK, the CAS Network explored how collections can be made available, digitally, for large-scale computational research. 
In collaboration with the Humanities and Data Science Turing Interest Group, the final event of the CAS Network will take place at The Alan Turing Institute on 20 January 2020.
By bringing together experts from various disciplines and backgrounds, this closing event of the Network aims to explore and discuss why, and how to best, integrate computational thinking into archival theory and practice.
The event will include a keynote speech, short talks and panel discussions where experts will be encouraged to share knowledge, exchange ideas and explore common interests and challenges. The investigators of the Network will present the first outputs of the collaboration and discuss next steps.
For more information about the CAS Network and its activities, you can visit the network’s page at computationalarchives.net.
