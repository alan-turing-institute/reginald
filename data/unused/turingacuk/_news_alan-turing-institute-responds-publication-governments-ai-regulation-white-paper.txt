The government has published its white paper on artificial intelligence (AI) regulation setting out the UK’s approach to regulating AI. 
 
The white paper, from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, provides a roadmap for how the UK’s sector-specific approach to AI regulation will work in practice. The Turing believes this approach, that draws on the strength of the UK’s existing regulators, is crucial to the effective regulation of AI.  
 
Five principles will guide the use of AI in the UK, as part of a new national blueprint for regulators to steer responsible AI innovation and maintain public trust in this technology.  
 
The government has long recognised the crucial role of standards in encouraging responsible innovation. And as detailed in the white paper the AI Standards Hub, an initiative led by The Alan Turing Institute in partnership with BSI and NPL, will play an important role in the government’s vision for AI governance.   
 
The white paper also aims to create a central function to help monitor developments and identify risks. A recent Turing report supports the government recommendation for central capacity building and greater coordination across regulators to meet the challenge of regulating activities transformed by AI. 
 
Organisations and individuals working with AI can share their views on the white paper as part of a new consultation launching today.  The government's emphasis on stakeholder engagement and the recognition of the need for an iterative approach to AI regulation are crucial elements, which will enable the UK to finetune its approach.
Sir Adrian Smith, Institute Director at The Alan Turing Institute, said: “This white paper is good news for how AI is used and regulated in the UK. We’re very pleased to see that the government’s approach builds on the strength of existing regulators. A principle-based, sectoral approach is crucial to ensure that AI is regulated in the most effective and efficient way. 
“As the national institute for AI, we look forward to contributing to the consultation and working alongside the government to fulfil its ambition for the UK to be a powerhouse for responsible AI.”
