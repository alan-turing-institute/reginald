Cosmina joined The Alan Turing Institute in January 2018 to set up the public policy research programme. Starting from scratch in 2018, the programme now has 40+ full-time employees and 70+ affiliated researchers. Within the UK, more than public sector organisations reached out for help, and the programme's researchers conducted 100,000s of hours of work to support these organisations. Outside the UK, the programme has gained international recognition. The European Commission highlighted the value of the Turing’s public policy programme in its flagship policy report on AI, while the OECD identified the programme as a highly successful model in its primer on AI for the public sector.
Cosmina sits on the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Financial Services Artificial Intelligence Public-Private Forum, as well as the Department for International Trade's Trade and Economy Panel. She is a regular participant in various working groups, such as the Regulators and AI working group and the London Emerging Tech Charter working group. She also sits on the Advisory Board of Patterns, a data science journal published by Cell Press. In the past, she was a member of the UK Government's Digital and Telecoms Expert Trade Advisory Group. 
Prior to joining the Institute, Cosmina was an Executive Director and co-founder of Aurora Energy Research, a company that now has 200 employees and is the UK’s leading energy market modelling and analytics firms. She also spent five years at Google, defining the company’s investment and business strategy in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. 
Cosmina has an MPhil (obtained with Distinction) and a DPhil (PhD) in Economics from the University of Oxford. She has been a Research Associate at the University's Oxford Internet Institute since 2018.
Since joining the Turing, Cosmina’s invited lectures, talks, and public appearances include:
Cosmina has a deep interest in working with unconventional data and new modelling approaches to improve policy makers’ understanding of the world. At the Turing, she is co-leading a large-scale, 3-year research project on measuring policy impact in the Covid-19 crisis and building resilience against future shocks. The project's primary aim is to produce data, methodologies, and tools that help policy-makers make better informed choices. 
In the past, Cosmina worked with large datasets from online platforms like Google to study international e-commerce patterns as well as online advertising auctions. She led research collaborations with organisations like the European Commission, aimed at quantifying the impediments to cross-border e-commerce within the digital single market.
