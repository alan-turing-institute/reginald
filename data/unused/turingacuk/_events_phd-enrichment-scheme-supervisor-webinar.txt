The Enrichment scheme is the Turing’s flagship PhD programme which has evolved year on year since its inception in 2016. The scheme offers 6 or 9 month placements at the Turing HQ and is designed to give students the opportunity to enhance, refresh, and broaden their research with the Turing’s community.  
The application process is highly competitive. Eligible applicants must be supported by their supervisor, who will continue this role throughout the student's time on the Enrichment scheme. It should be noted that the scheme does not require students to stop the clock on their PhD. For this reason we want to offer a platform for supervisors to hear more about the scheme, understand the aims and benefits and ask any questions they might have. We hope that supervisors will feel better equipped to encourage students to apply and support them with writing a successful application. 
The 50-minute webinar will comprise of an introduction to the Enrichment scheme, a brief session on eligibility, a presentation by an academic who has previously supervised Enrichment scheme students, and an open forum Q&A session. 
Following on from our successful student open days held in November and December 2022, we recognise that there has not been an opportunity previously for supervisors to engage with us regarding the scheme. This webinar is open to university staff from all institutions, regardless of affiliation with the Turing, which we hope will support our objective of building wider connections and diversifying our applicant pool via future cohorts. 
Supervisors must support their student’s application and be available to provide a reference if the candidate is successful. This event will provide an open forum to query anything that could affect their decision to do so and will enable those who have not heard of the scheme to encourage their students to apply. 
The webinar aims to provide supervisors with an opportunity to understand the benefits of the Enrichment scheme and better support their students to gain a place. 
 
We welcome participation from all backgrounds, but this event will be of interest to those who supervise PhD students in a wide range of disciplines.
