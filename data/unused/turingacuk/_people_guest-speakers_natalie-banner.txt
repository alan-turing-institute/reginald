Dr Natalie Banner leads Understanding Patient Data (UPD), an initiative hosted at Wellcome to ensure uses of patient data for care and research are more visible, understandable and trustworthy. This involves creating accessible information resources about data use, commissioning and collating public attitudes and engagement research, and channelling these insights into policy and decision-making to ensure that diverse public views and values are embedded in data governance. UPD’s work includes exploring how to create trustworthy frameworks for developing new data-driven technologies in healthcare and research, focused on ensuring benefits back to patients and the health system.
Natalie formerly managed Wellcome’s Parliamentary advocacy on GDPR and data protection, leading the research sector response to ensure UK legislation and regulation created a supportive environment for research using patient and health-related data. Prior to joining Wellcome, Natalie was a postdoctoral research fellow in philosophy at King’s College London.
