Now open for submissions, the Cambridge University Press Data-Centric Engineering journal is a cutting edge, cross-disciplinary and open access journal focusing on research at the intersection of data science and a broad range of engineering subjects. It covers the use of data science methods to model systems downstream from the lab in order to build prototypes and engineering solutions that are safer, more resilient and fitter for purpose.
Mark Girolami, Chief Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, is Data-Centric Engineering's Editor-in-Chief.
The journal will publish the following types of peer-reviewed paper:
Data-Centric Engineering welcomes contributions from researchers in academia and industry that explore:
