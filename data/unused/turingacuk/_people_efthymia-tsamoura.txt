Efi Tsamoura received her BSc in 2007 and her PhD in 2013 with honours both from the Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. Since June 2013 she is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science Department of University of Oxford, working on problems related to querying semantically interrelated resources. Her research interests lie in the fields of data integration, query answering under constraints, distributed query optimisation, multi-objective query optimisation and grid computing. Efi received several distinctions and awards both during her undergraduate and postgraduate studies.  She currently works at Samsung AI Centre.
Efi is one of the co-organisers of the Neuro-symbolic AI interest Group.
