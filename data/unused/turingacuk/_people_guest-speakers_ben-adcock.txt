Ben Adcock is a professor of mathematics at Simon Fraser University.  He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge, receiving his BA in 2005, MMath in 2006, and PhD in 2011. His PhD was in the Numerical Analysis group, under the supervision of Arieh Iserles.  From 2010 to 2012 he held NSERC and PIMS (the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences) postdoctoral fellowships at Simon Fraser University, working with Nilima Nigam.  He was an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at Purdue University from 2012 to 2014, before returning to Canada in August of that year as an assistant professor. He was promoted to associate professor in September 2018 and full professor in September 2021.
He received the CAIMS/PIMS Early Career Award in 2017, an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2015 and a Leslie Fox Prize in Numerical Analysis in 2011.
He has published over 50 peer-reviewed journal articles, 15 conference proceedings, and two book chapters. His work has also been featured on the cover of SIAM News. Further information about his research can be found on his Research and Publications pages.
He is currently PIMS-SFU Site Director and a member of the CAIMS (Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society) board. He is also a member of the Editorial Board for the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, and the SIAM Computational Science and Engineering book series. From 2015-2017 he was secretary of the SIAM Pacific Northwest Section.
He is the primary organizer for the 2020 Foundations of Computational Mathematics conference.
