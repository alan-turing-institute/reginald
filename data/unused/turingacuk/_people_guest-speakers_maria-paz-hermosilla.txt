Maria Paz Hermosilla is currently the Director of GobLab UAI – the public innovation lab at the Adolfo Ibanez University’s School of Government – whose mission is to help transform the public sector through data science. She has a Master of Public Administration from New York University. She is the Academic director of a certificate program in Data Science and Public Policy and researcher and professor of Data Ethics for graduate programs in the School of Engineering, School of Business and School of Government. She is leading several research projects related to the use of data science to improve public policy, including predictive models in the social sector, the integration of data ethics into the public procurement process, and algorithmic transparency. She was appointed by the Chilean Ministry of Science in the expert advisory committee to create the national strategy for Artificial Intelligence, and in the national committee for Public Interest Data. Before her current appointments, she was the Head of the Citizen Relations and Information Management Unit of the Chilean Ministry of Public Works, leading the redesign of citizen services and open data initiatives.
