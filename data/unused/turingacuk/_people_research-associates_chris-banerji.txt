Chris is a Senior Research Associate with the Turing-Roche Partnership. As an interdisciplinary clinician-scientist Chris has a strong interest in mathematical and computational approaches to big biomedical data analysis, with the aim of understanding pathological heterogeneity at all levels (from molecular to clinical). His previous work has focused on biomarker and therapeutic discovery in muscular dystrophy, as well as cancer prognostics and stem cell biology. His academic work has been recognised by several international prizes, including the Muscular Dystrophy UK President’s Award for best Early Career Researcher.

Prior to joining the Turing, Chris studied Mathematics at Oxford before undertaking his PhD in computational and cell biology at UCL. After his PhD he studied clinical medicine as a graduate at Imperial College London and was subsequently employed as an academic clinician at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, throughout the COVID pandemic. During his clinical training and employment, he has held a Visiting Postdoctoral position at King’s College London facilitating his ongoing research.
 
Chris is particularly interested in: stochastic modelling of gene expression, dynamical systems applied to cell-cell interactions, single cell/nuclear RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, network theory (applied to protein interactions), information theory (applied to biological signal transduction), transcriptomic biomarkers, cellular differentiation (in particular muscle regeneration and malignancy), clinical subtyping in heterogeneous pathology and classification approaches, dynamic image analysis, and importantly rare diseases. He would be delighted to discuss any of these topics and welcomes collaboration.
