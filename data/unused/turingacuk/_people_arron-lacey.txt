Arron holds a BSc in Physics, MSc and MRes in Computer Science and a PhD in Health Data Science at Swansea University. Arron has 10 years experience conducting Neurology and Cardiovascular research at the SAIL databank and more recently lead the Natural Language Processing group at Swansea University and became a Lecturer in 2019. Since 2014 Arron has been module lead on Machine Learning in Healthcare on the MSc Health Data Science course at Swansea University, and since 2019 two undergraduate modules on the BSc Population Health.
Arron is now an Honorary Lecturer at Swansea University after taking up the role of Senior Community Manager on the Early Detection of Neurodegenerative Diseases (EDoN) initiative lead by Alzheimer's Research UK. He hopes to use his experience in Machine Learning to help the EDoN initiative achieving it's goal of detecting cognitive decline 10-15 years before symptoms show in the brain, making current treatments more effective. EDoN aims to do this by building a digital toolkit consisting of mobile apps, Fitbit and cutting edge passive EEG monitoring to help detect signals of early cognitive decline.
Arron works in the Tools, Practices and Systems programme at the Turing and contributes to the Turing Way Project from within the Whitaker Lab.
