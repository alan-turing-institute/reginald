Pushmeet Kohli is the Head of AI for Science at DeepMind, leading efforts including AlphaFold, a state-of-the-art AI system for predicting the 3D structure of proteins. Prior to this, he was the director of research at the Cognition group at Microsoft Research.
Pushmeet's research centres on using AI to solve impactful real world science-related problems. He is particularly interested in the use of machine learning techniques to enable and accelerate life sciences research, and the use of this knowledge for understanding and intervening in disease. Pushmeet also actively leads research on new techniques to ensure that AI systems are safe, reliable and trustworthy.
Pushmeet’s papers have won multiple awards and appeared in conferences in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, game theory and human computer interaction. His research has also been covered by popular media outlets such as Wired, Forbes, BBC, New Scientist and MIT Technology Review.
