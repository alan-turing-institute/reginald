My research interests sit at the intersection of gender-based violence, migration, and public health using computational social science methods. My PhD explores low-wage labour migration pathways between Myanmar and Thailand to inform safer migration interventions aiming to prevent human trafficking and labour exploitation. This research incorporates complex systems and social network theory using egocentric network analysis, interactive visualisations, and multi-scale agent-based modelling. I am interested in collaborating with others on developing new methods to calibrate and validate ABMs informed by empirical mixed-methods data in data scarce research areas.

[email protected]
I'm interested in the pragmatic application of machine learning to climate physics. Weather and climate poses a lot of interesting problems. And some of the solutions, but certainly not all, could be ML. Previously, I studied unsupervised ML for isolating the natural variability of our climate. More recently, I've been using cycleGANs to make our climate simulations match observations better. I'm also interested in how ML models can be used to replace the nastier parts of weather models.
