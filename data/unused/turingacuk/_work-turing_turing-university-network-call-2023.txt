Applications will be made on behalf of institutions, not individuals, and are therefore limited to one per university.  
The Alan Turing Institute is delighted to invite applications from universities across the UK to join the Turing University Network.  
In line with the goals of the new Institute Strategy, the Turing is building a structured and inclusive university network representative of the wider data science and AI community in the UK. The network provides all UK universities with an interest in data science and AI the opportunity to engage and collaborate both with the Institute and its broader networks.  
Universities who join will be part of a national data science and AI network that does not exist elsewhere in the UK. The network is designed to be open, with minimal barriers to both entry and bureaucracy, and will provide enablers such as mechanisms to connect across the ecosystem, interesting problems and routes to impact.  
The Turing University Network launched as a pilot in April 2023 and we are pleased to now launch an open call for new members. Full information can be found in the call documents below.  
"We are delighted to invite universities from across the UK to join the Turing University Network, as we strive to build a structured and inclusive community, representative of the broader data science and AI landscape. Joining this national network offers universities the opportunity to engage and collaborate with the Institute and its extensive networks, creating a unique platform for innovation and impact in data science and AI."
Professor Mark Girolami, Chief Scientist, Alan Turing Institute
