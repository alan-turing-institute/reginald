A regular series of open invitation talks from leading voices in data science, AI, healthcare and those with lived experience dealing with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC). This seminar series is part of the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility (RSF) project.
Event title: DExtER, a semi-automated epidemiology platform for electronic health record research
Speaker: Professor Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar, Professor in Health Data Science and Public Health, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham
The NHS provides healthcare to 66 million people, with over a million people utilising NHS services every day. Each of these encounters is an opportunity to learn however, this data is often poorly accessible and not in research-ready formats. 
 
In this session, we will learn more about University of Birmingham’s system, DExtER (PMID: 32856160), a semi-automated system for efficient, transparent and reproducible research. This brings together experts in epidemiology, data science and software engineering. Studies which used to take months, can now be undertaken within days. For example, DExtER enabled the analysis of >70,000 serum testosterone measurements in young women, identifying increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes in women with androgen excess. This led to a major new experimental medicine study (DAISy-PCOS) stratifying risk and developing novel treatments to prevent metabolic complications in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, a lifelong condition affecting 1 in 10 women worldwide. DExtER will also support the recently awarded MuMPreDiCT consortium that will study the effect of multiple long-term conditions on pregnancy outcomes.
 
In the session, we will also hear about how such an approach has the potential to:
This talk is part of an ongoing series of events hosted by the AIM RSF, which aims to share information and learning on aspects of interest to the MLTC research community.
