Together, The Alan Turing Institute and its partners have invested more than £26m in digital twin research and innovation across a range of dynamic projects, including developing foundational theory and applications in the engineering, environmental and social sciences. This represents one of the largest and most exciting portfolios of academic digital twin research and innovation in the UK. 
To build on this activity, we are now establishing a new Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT). 

While digital twin technology has proven to be powerful in a range of areas, current digital twins are often highly bespoke, and their development and deployment to address real-world problems requires specialised expertise and computational infrastructure. This has created a barrier that can limit use. As with other powerful computational technologies, realising the potential of digital twins requires a robust, user-friendly implementation open to all.
The primary objective of the TRIC-DT is to democratise access to digital twin technology by providing open and reproducible computational and social tools freely accessible to the UK research and innovation communities. This vision will be achieved by establishing knowledge exchange between a central Turing Innovation and Impact Hub and a network of collaborators across the academic and private sectors.
Research and innovation activity will focus on solving significant societal challenges and generating tangible societal benefits in three interrelated areas:
These are in partnership with a small number of key research and industrial development partners. The purpose of these focus areas is to provide compelling case studies that illustrate the power of digital twins and act as exemplars to help support the evolution of a national digital twins research and innovation community.
As the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, we are well-positioned to accept the challenge of developing the nation’s digital twins capability. The Turing will take a lead role in democratising digital twin technology, drawing on its broad, multidisciplinary academic expertise, to enable the widespread use for societal and economic benefit.
The three focus areas will deliver a set of outstanding case study projects, enabling digital twins to move from a bespoke technology to a more easily adoptable industrial technology. The TRIC-DT will be organised to support this by ensuring a flow of information and shared expertise between the focus areas. The organisational model includes programme management and partnership development support.
 
Additionally, a vibrant Innovation and Impact Hub (the Hub) based at the Turing will deliver and demonstrate impact from the TRIC-DT research portfolio.
The Innovation and Impact Hub is responsible for supporting the TRIC-DT’s goal of democratising access to digital twin technology by providing open and reproducible computational and social tools freely accessible to the UK research and innovation communities. As such, a primary role and objective of the Hub will be to coordinate and consolidate research activity in the three challenge areas of the TRIC-DT, and ensure flow of tools, methods and techniques between areas, as appropriate.
The Hub will achieve this objective using a variety of complementary activities, organised into four broad (and interconnected) themes:
Each of these themes and their associated activities will be accompanied by a set of appropriate measures to help track progress towards the goals of the TRIC-DT, and the tasks and themes will be regularly evaluated to ensure they are in alignment with objectives of the TRICT-DT.
The Hub will consist of:
A 2-day workshop discussing AI and sustainability centred on the theme of ‘Cities’ that examines the role of data science and artificial intelligence in paving the way for sustainable cities. Dr Cassandra Gould Van Praag, Senior Research Community Manager will be speaking on the TRIC-DT Innovation and Impact Hub. 
This Open for Business event on 7 June was part of an INI programme on the mathematical and statistical foundation of future data-driven engineering and brought together the community to discuss the latest research and innovation in digital twinning for engineering, providing an opportunity for networking and help foster cross-disciplinary connections.
Prof David Wagg and Prof Keith Worden from the TRIC-DT leadership opened and chairing this engaging session.
This Senior Stakeholder Forum builds upon a roundtable conversation last March, where it was recommended that leaders in the environmental digital twin development space re-convene to share progress, align priorities and establish an ongoing Senior Stakeholder Forum for a UK Community of Digital Twins. Chaired by Professor Stephen Belcher, Chief Scientist at the Met Office.
A Pilot IMFe: Piloting an Information Management Framework for Environmental Digital Twins, led event.
As part of the TRIC-DT there has been a programme of international visiting scholars, to help develop partnerships and cross sector research development. On 13 March three of the TRIC-DT visiting scholars joined the Co-Director team for a networking session to support the partnerships ambition.
Delivered with support from the Turing, Imperial College British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Wellcome Trust/EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering..
Bringing together clinicians, industry and academics, providing an opportunities to move towards a common understanding of, and expectations for, a digital twin and identify opportunities to move this technology from a research area into a clinical application.
Attended by over 100 delegates from across industry, academia and government.
A hybrid workshop hosted by Faculty of Engineering, University of Sheffield and AMRC exploring digital twins in practice, supported by Turing.
