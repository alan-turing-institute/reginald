Despite rapid innovation in artificial intelligence that has the potential to impact future generations and their relationship with technology, there is little research done to examine children’s experiences of AI. Our project involves engaging with children to explore what children think about AI, how they would like to see AI developed in the future, and how children can become more involved in shaping AI innovation, policy, and governance. From our public engagement work, we aim to use our findings to inform policymakers to support the development of child-centred AI.

Whether in education, health, or in everyday lives, AI presents specific opportunities and challenges for children. Particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, children have been more connected than ever, where physical forms of interaction, play, and schooling have migrated online. Some of these changes have been made permanent, with hybrid tools remaining in place. While research has been done to explore how adults engage with AI and algorithmic systems, much less has been done to assess their impact on children’s lives.
As part of our project, we aim to bring together multidisciplinary research expertise and methodologies to examine children’s understanding, knowledge, and engagement with AI and digital technologies. This includes conducting exploratory literature reviews, surveys, and public engagement work within and outside of the classroom to investigate the socio-technical and policy implications of children’s current perceptions of AI.
Bridging the gap between theoretical considerations of children’s interaction with technology and empirical insight into their opinions, aspirations, and questions about AI, our project team aims to support developments on policy, curricula, and the deployment of AI technologies for children to ensure that children’s considerations are involved in decision-making about future uses of AI for their own benefit.

This programme of work is being undertaken through several interrelated research projects: 
In 2020, as a policy pilot partner with UNICEF, we conducted research to pilot UNICEF’s draft guidance on child-centred AI. This research was published by UNICEF as a case study in 2021. Our research demonstrated a lack of research into children’s experiences with AI, and a pressing need to engage with children and young people to underpin their future involvement in the development of child-centred AI. Our research also indicated that many public sector organisations recognise the importance of involving children in the design, development, and deployment of AI systems that use their data, but that they lack the experience, resources, or skills to do so.  
In 2022, we began conducting a review of existing frameworks relating to children’s rights and AI in the UK and internationally. This includes UNICEF’s Policy Guidance on AI for Children 2.0, the World Economic Forum’s Artificial Intelligence for Children Toolkit, the ICO’s Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the UK’s proposed Online Safety Bill amongst others. This in-depth review examines the ways that children’s rights are being advanced and protected in relation to AI and seeks to inform best practice in child-centred AI. The outputs of this research will provide a comparative analysis of existing frameworks, synergies and differences, and challenges surrounding the implementation and enforcement of such frameworks. We recently presented preliminary findings of this research and are set to publish our work in the near future.

Since 2022, we have been collaborating with the Children's Parliament and the Scottish AI Alliance to engage primary school children aged  7-11 across Scotland on AI and children’s rights. A series of introductory workshops have been held with 87 children in four schools across Scotland including Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirlingshire, and Shetland. Following this, we are working with children from across these schools who will continue to be engaged over the next two years. This project is exploring how children feel about AI, how they would like to see AI developed in the future and how children would like to be involved in the development and governance of AI.  
As part of this project, we travelled up and around Scotland to meet and work with all 87 children teaching them about children’s rights and AI but, more importantly, learning about what matters to them in this area. Our team developed creative and interactive ways to explain foundational AI concepts, for instance how an algorithm works and what machine learning is.

We have also collaborated with the Children’s Parliament to continue to work with a core ‘AI investigators’ team of 13 children across the four schools. From November 2022 – February 2023 we ran six 90-minute workshops, each of which focused on a different theme of children’s rights and AI. Children shared their thoughts on bias, fairness, where AI may be used in their day to day lives, and how AI may be better developed to uphold children’s rights. They quickly grasped difficult concepts like how algorithms are used in prediction, recommendation, and classification.     
In an additional set of four online sessions, the children had the opportunity to ask us questions based on real-world AI case-studies. We were impressed with the variety and depth of questions asked, such as the limitations of facial recognition for identical twins and improving training data to reduce bias. One case study focused on AI in healthcare where children expressed concerns about accessibility and asked how AI devices can be designed to be more accessible for the elderly and younger individuals. Children explicitly mentioned their ‘right to privacy’ and asked, "how fair is it for companies to collect information [data] about children?". Other children said, "a lot of games try and get children to spend money" and wanted to learn about how to better safeguard themselves online. Children also showed empathetic considerations pointing to the digital divide and asked, "is it fair that some children do not have access to AI [devices]?"  
Our project report, summarising the first stage of our engagements with children in Scotland, identifies four key themes drawn from the investigator’s participation: AI & Education, Fairness & Bias, Safety & Security, and The Future of AI. In the next phase of this research, we are continuing to collaborate with the Children’s Parliament and Scottish AI Alliance to explore these themes, and to develop and test new approaches to engaging children in decision-making and policy-making relating to AI in Scotland.

In 2023, we began our collaboration with the Council of Europe Steering Committee for the Rights of the Child to design, develop, and implement a mapping study exploring the extent to which children’s rights have been considered in the context of AI across member states. This piece of research will provide evidence on existing frameworks in place and gaps to be addressed and will support the CoE Strategy for the Rights of the Child. 
We asked if children think they should have a say in how AI is made and developed and they said:
“Yes. To evolve their [children’s] future and make sure nothing bad’s going to happen…And make their future better. And everyone’s future – better." - P5 Student, Glasgow, Scotland 
AI is increasingly part of children's day-to-day lives with impacts often realised only in retrospect. Understanding the ways in which children understand, experience, and engage with AI could provide much-needed guidance for policymakers, AI developers, and affected stakeholders to inform future approaches to child-centred AI.
Specifically, our research engaging children across Scotland on AI and children’s rights will contribute towards Scotland’s AI Strategy to ‘Develop Scotland’s approach to AI and children’. It can also help to build out not only protections for children currently set out in the GDPR and Age-Appropriate Design Code, but also empower children in their use and understanding of digital technologies.
Broader applications and benefits of this project include critical research needed to lay the foundation and inform the landscape of children’s rights as they relate to AI, especially as new technologies that directly affect children continue to be developed and deployed.
With this research, the case for children to be included as a key stakeholder group and be meaningfully involved in the development of child-centred AI will be further strengthened and help to ensure their voices are heard. This project also prioritises the diversity and inclusion of minority and marginalised groups as a key component throughout to ensure that future research applications are relevant and beneficial to all children.
