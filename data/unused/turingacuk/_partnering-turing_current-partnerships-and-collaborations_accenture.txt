Accenture and The Alan Turing Institute have been working together since 2017, during which time they have conducted joint research projects into new techniques for network analytics for use in fraud detection, for example, in telecommunications. They have also run Data Study Groups to tackle challenges facing AI professionals, such as fairness in algorithmic decision-making.
In 2020 we launched a five-year strategic partnership with Accenture that will sit within the finance and economics programme. Our partnership will build on an existing three-year alliance to create a world-leading strategic partnership in advanced data science, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) research with a focus on delivering substantial business and societal value.
Some of the activities the partnership plans to undertake include conducting joint research in data science and AI across many areas including: 
The partnership will also deliver engagement activities to help transform executives’ understanding of how AI and data science can be used as a tool for business. This will include guest lectures and seminars as well as internship opportunities for a range of students across the Turing network with Accenture and its clients.

Read an edited version of Adrian Smith’s keynote speech given at the Accenture-Turing Innovation Symposium on 18 November 2021. This virtual event provided a unique opportunity for industry and academia to come together to discuss the research that is pioneering the conscientious uses of data science and AI, in areas including privacy, explainability, fairness and security.

The government sees the National AI Strategy as fundamental to the UK’s economic growth over the next ten years. Mark Girolami, Chief Scientist of The Alan Turing Institute, and Accenture's Fernando Lucini discuss what this means for business and society. As a global AI powerhouse, UK business is already seeing opportunities to grow and transform.
 
The latest episode of the Turing Podcast features a special roundtable discussion with Accenture about career options in the data science sector. Hosts Jo Dungate and Bea Costa Gomes were joined by three influential figures in AI and data science: Henrietta Ridley (Data Science Manager at Accenture), Alice Aspinall (Senior Manager at Mudano) and Kirstie Whitaker (the Turing’s Programme Director for Tools, Practices and Systems).

Adrian Smith
In addition to his role at the Turing, Adrian is President of the Royal Society, and a member of the government’s national AI council. In this talk, Adrian discusses the UK’s national data and AI strategies; focusing in on the key challenges to industry.
Mihaela van der Schaar
Mihaela is John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Medicine at the University of Cambridge, and Turing Fellow. The Current emphasis of her research is on synthetic data with applications to medicine, finance and education. In this talk she focuses on new evaluation metrics for synthetic data generation.
Timothy Dodwell
Timothy is a senior lecturer in industrial applied mathematics within the Institute of Data Science and AI at the University of Exeter, and Turing Fellow. His work addresses the challenge of building a more sustainable aviation industry by building a virtual test pyramid. In this talk he focuses on deploying reinforcement learning in safety critical systems, as well as the Turing’s prosperity partnership with NATS.
Maria Liakata
Maria is a Professor in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at Queen Mary University of London and Turing Fellow. Her work utilises language data obtained from wide-spread use of digital technology such as social media as well as mobile phone data to develop novel natural language processing methods for automatically capturing changes in user behaviour over time. In this talk she looks at the applicability to mental health as NLP techniques will help provide experts with evidence for personalised changes in mood and cognition from everyday use of digital technologies.
Jose Miguel Hernandez Lobato
Jose is a lecturer in Machine Learning at the Department of Engineering of the University of Cambridge. His work focuses on increasing robustness in machine learning methods using probabilistic approaches. This talk addresses key concerns around providing training data collected under differing conditions.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic brought into sharp focus the need for new data science and AI skills. Looking ahead, it’s clear we’re going to need data-informed non-therapeutic interventions to limit any resurgence of the virus for years to come.
