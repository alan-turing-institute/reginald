Adam is a PhD candidate in Urban Science with the Warwick Institute for the Science of Cities, supervised by Dr. Alexandra I. Cristea and Dr. Maria Liakata. His main research interests are in the areas of Social Media Mining and Natural Language Processing, with a primary focus on sentiment analysis from social media and their implications in real-world events.
Over 70% of the global population is expected to live in big cities by the next 30 years. At the same time, the use of social media is growing at tremendous rates. Motivated by these basic facts, Adam's work focuses on opinion mining of social media users, as an attempt to model and predict urban-related indices (e.g., elections, wellbeing, etc.). The effective modelling of such domains is a challenging and important task, as it can provide additional "sensors" for informing citizens and policy makers on the current state of an urban environment, but also on possible consequences of their actions.
