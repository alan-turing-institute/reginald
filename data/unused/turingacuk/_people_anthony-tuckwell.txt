Anthony is a PhD student at the Economics department of the University of Warwick and an enrichment student at the Turing.
His research uses methods from behavioural and experimental economics, applied econometrics, machine learning and natural language processing to understand important questions for society and the economy and to develop new tools for future research. It has been supported by a scholarship from the Economic & Social Research Council and grants awarded by the Mind & Life Institute and the CAGE Research Centre at the University of Warwick.
Prior to his PhD, Anthony completed an MRes and MSc at Warwick and a BSc at the University of Bath.
Anthony's research focuses mainly on topics from cultural and behavioural economics. In particular he has interests in religious and political values, identity, mindfulness and, most recently, music. At the Turing he is working on one project that uses natural language processing to explore the close relationship between religion and politics in the US, and on another that applies emotion-classification algorithms to music to investigate the link between musical expression and its social context.
