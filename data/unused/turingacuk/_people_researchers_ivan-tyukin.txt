Find out more about the expert commentary the Turing can provide
Professor Ivan Tyukin is an expert in the mathematical foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learning systems, Machine Learning, mathematical modelling, adaptive systems, inverse problems with nonconvex and nonlinear parameterization, data analytics, and computer vision.
Professor Tyukin has been awarded a prestigious Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship to lead innovative and creative AI research with transformative impact. He is a member of the IFAC Technical Committee on Adaptive and Learning Systems, an Editor of Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulations, and is a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group on AI's data governance task force which examines the economic, social, and ethical implications of AI. He has a broad network of academic and industrial collaborators includes strategic UK sectors such as public safety and security, health technologies, space and Earth Observation, and manufacturing.
Professor Tyukin’s recent work focuses on creating a theory and practice for developing AI systems that are provably robust, resilient, certifiable, trustworthy, human-centric and data-driven. The theory will enable the creation of new-generation AI systems which are certifiably stable, secure, adaptive and maintainable. These systems will be prepared to handle the challenges of adversarial attacks and data inconsistences, uncertainties, and bias inherent within any empirical data. This will enable new gold standard methods and tools in tasks that are currently heavily reliant upon non-deterministic human input to have long-term transformation.
