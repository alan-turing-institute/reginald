A world-leading centre for the technical underpinnings of safe and ethical AI which is trustworthy to encourage responsible innovation and cutting-edge research breakthroughs. Our work connects broadly with inter-disciplinary experts, industry, government, regulators, civil society and other stakeholders to ensure that we build the right tools for society.
The key aim of this strategic challenge of the Turing’s AI programme is to establish a centre of excellence for the study of technical aspects of safe and ethical AI, in line with the government’s Industrial Strategy and in step with global demand for research and guidance in this domain.  This will be achieved by conducting deep theoretical research, looking for rigorous, quantifiable and verifiable guarantees, and pushing the state-of-the-art frontiers, to enable trustworthy deployment. Key themes include: 
To achieve this, it will be vital to interface well with other disciplines, policy makers, industry and the public.
 
AI systems are rapidly being developed and deployed across society. This creates tremendous opportunities, but also raises a pressing need to ensure that these systems are safe and ethical in order to function properly, grow public trust and avoid a potential backlash.
What is missing in the UK landscape is a major effort to build the necessary technical foundations for this endeavour. Knowing how to regulate in a way that fosters innovation, while providing optimal guard rails for society, will not be possible without this effort. We propose to establish a centre of excellence for the study of technical aspects of safe and ethical AI at the Turing, to build the technical underpinnings for trustworthy deployment, responsible innovation and appropriate governance.
This is not a one-off endeavour but will require continual upgrading as the technology evolves. There are trade-offs between desirable goals for society (eg privacy and transparency, individual vs societal benefit). Our aim is to enable the best possible frontier across these goals and communicate with policy makers and the public to help ensure that the right point on the frontier is enforced.

From November 2021 to January 2022, The Alan Turing Institute and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) hosted a series of workshops about fairness in AI. The aim of the series was to assist the ICO in the development of an update to the fairness component of its existing non-statutory guidance on AI and data protection, by convening key stakeholders from industry, policy, and academia to identify the key issues and challenges around fairness in AI, and to discuss possible solutions. The guidance is part of ICO25’s Action Plan for 2022-2023. The update to the guidance has now been published, and the ICO will ensure any further updates will reflect upcoming changes in relation to AI regulation and data protection.

The paper published by Sandra Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt and Chris Russell in March 2020, 'Why fairness cannot be automated: Bridging the gap between EU non-discrimination law and AI', explains which parts of AI fairness can, cannot and should not be automated and suggests ideas for legally compliant algorithmic bias audits.

A workshop between UK, France and Canada, 'CIFAR-UKRI-CNRS AI and Society: From Principles to Practice' at the Turing, provided a forum for AI ethics researchers in the UK, France and Canada to meet and exchange notes on their recent work through a series of brief presentations. This utilised the Turing’s convening power to bolster the creation of cross-country research teams to apply for collaborative funding and at the same time raised the profile of the Institute in AI ethics across the UK, France and Canada.

Google's 'What-If Tool' as part of their TensorFlow™ machine learning framework, is an open source software library for high performance computation and a widely used deep learning framework. The tool enables non-technical individuals to easily understand what their machine learning is doing and allows the user to edit examples from datasets and show how the model’s predictions change as any single feature is changed.

Turing researchers from diverse fields have produced a new way of approaching fairness in algorithm-led decisions, by looking at the causes of certain factors that can often result in biased decision-making.
