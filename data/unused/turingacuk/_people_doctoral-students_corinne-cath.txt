Corinne Cath is a doctoral student at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) and a cultural anthropologist. 
Prior to joining the Turing Institute, she worked at human rights NGO ARTICLE 19 and as a policy advisor for the US House of Representatives in Washington D.C.  She has an MSc in Social Science of the Internet from the University of Oxford, an MA in Conflict Studies and BA in anthropology from the University of Utrecht.
Her research covers engineering culture, Internet governance, and the social significance of technologies like artificial intelligence. For her doctoral project, she focuses on public interest advocacy in engineering organizations. She is working on these issues under the guidance of Professor Luciano Floridi and Professor Victoria Nash. 
Early 2018, she published as first editor a Special Edition with the Royal Society on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI).
At the Turing, she co-convenes the Protocol Governance interest group. 
When she is not at her standing desk at the Turing, she can be found online @C_Cath (T) or ccath_incc (Insta).
