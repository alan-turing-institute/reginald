Juergen Branke is Professor of Operational Research and Systems at Warwick Business School, and Director of Warwick’s Data Science for Social Good programme. He studied Industrial Engineering and Management at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, where he also did his PhD in Applied Computer Science in 2000. He worked as Researcher and Lecturer at the University of Karlsruhe until moving to the University of Warwick in 2009. Juergen is the Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization and Area/Associate Editor of several other journals. He enjoys working with industry and has done various projects with industry in logistics, engineering, and telecommunication.
 
Juergen's research area lies at the interface of machine learning and optimisation and falls into the broader field of prescriptive analytics, i.e., how to use data and models to make optimal decisions. In particular, he works on methods such as metaheuristcs and Bayesian optimisation to tackle problems that involve uncertainty, are dynamically changing over time, or involve multiple, conflicting objectives.
