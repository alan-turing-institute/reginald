Antonella Maia Perini is a Research Associate in Data Justice and Global Ethical Futures within the public policy programme.
Prior to joining The Alan Turing Institute, Antonella worked as Project Manager at the Latin-American think tank Asuntos del Sur, where she coordinated training programmes on democratic innovation and digital rights, and later led a research consortium of seven universities and organisations studying the governance models in the responses to COVID-19. She also conducted digital security workshops and research on open government and digitalisation. Furthermore, Antonella assisted research on disinformation and hate speech at the Oxford Internet Institute and contributed to research led by the Centre of Technology and Society (CETyS) and Centro Latam Digital that aimed to understand the levels of awareness and implementation of AI ethical principles in start-ups developing AI systems in Latin America. She co-founded Youth IGF Argentina and between 2018 and 2019 was the Latin America and Caribbean Representative at the Executive Committee of the Non-Commercial Users Constituency of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
 
Antonella holds a BA in International Relations from Universidad de San Andrés (Argentina), an MA in International Relations by the University of Bologna, and an MSc in Social Science of the Internet by the Oxford Internet Institute from the University of Oxford. Her MSc dissertation sought to understand the way Latin American civil society organisations engage with discussions about ethics and governance of AI in Internet Governance arrangements, and how they interact with each other and the broader ecosystem.
At the Turing, Antonella has worked on the Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice project. She is working currently on a project on Equity in Medical Devices, as well as other projects which focus on the ethics of AI.
