Chris has always had a strong passion for interdisciplinary research and the marriage between the social and ‘hard’ sciences. He studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at the University of Warwick receiving a scholarship from the German National Academic Foundation. In 2017 he completed his MPhil in economics specialising in macroeconomics and financial economics at the University of Cambridge.  He wants to continue exploring the application of cutting-edge quantitative methods to the social sciences in his DPhil in computational social science at The Alan Turing Institute and the Oxford Internet Institute. 
Social media has given rise to some of the starkest challenges to our democracies with its phenomena of rising polarisation, ‘echo chambers’, and ‘fake news’. Chris is interested in the rigorous and quantitative analysis of the effects and implication of these problems. In particular, Chris is trying to uncover how fake news spread and influence opinion dynamics, political polarisation, and mobilisation. Moreover, he tries to model the formation and dynamics of so-called online echo chambers and their interplay with fake news propagation and political polarisation. For these investigations he is interested in developing new methods drawing from natural language processing, networks and clustering, as well as Bayesian analysis.
