Computer vision technology has had a huge impact within many scientific disciplines, however, it can be difficult for researchers unfamiliar with computer vision methods to determine the best algorithm for analysing their data. Scivision is an open-source software tool allowing users to explore a range of computer vision models and datasets hosted in the Scivision catalogue in order to find new ways to apply computer vision in their research. The Scivision community brings together computer vision experts and users to share data and methods, collaborate on new techniques, and discuss advances in computer vision.
Modern scientific research is inherently interdisciplinary. Scivision embraces this interdisciplinarity by bringing together researchers working across distinct domains of science, all of whom are using computer vision in their research. Rather than duplicating their work in independent silos, the researchers began by identifying common data challenges across projects that apply machine learning to the sciences. The Scivision framework cuts across different projects, agnostic to both the algorithms in use and the intended applications. As an example of how computer vision techniques are transferable across data from different disciplines, consider the case of mapreader for plant phenotyping.
Scivision aims to be a well-documented and generalisable framework for applying computer vision methods to a diverse range of imagery. The Scivision framework will serve as a bridge between data owners, or domain experts who collect and curate image datasets, and developers by:
Understanding how the genetics of plants interact with their environment to produce certain characteristics or 'phenotypes' is critical to understand how they might grow under different conditions. In relation to agriculture, extracting accurate data on phenotype may help us to better manage plants to produce higher-yield, more resilient crops, and plan for future food security by predicting how crops may grow under various climate change scenarios.
State-of-the-art plant phenotyping platforms have recently been established in the UK, such as the National Plant Phenomics Centre that collect high spatiotemporal resolution imagery of plants, as well as data on plant genetics and environmental conditions. However, extracting phenomic data from these images is expensive and time consuming to carry out manually.
We are working with the National Plant Phenomics Centre (NPPC) to automate extraction of plant phenotype data from various datasets, including time-series images of individual Brassica napus plants. We want to track the change and emergence of different plant structures (such as leaves, flowers, branches and seed pods) over time.
Through the Scivision framework we were able to load example plant data (at individual and satellite scale) and perform inference with a MapReader model trained on NPPC images of individual Brassica plants.
MapReader is an end-to-end computer vision (CV) pipeline developed to analyse historical maps as scale, using a patch classification approach to identify landscape features i.e. railways and buildings, and examine change in these classes over time. Through the Scivision framework we were able to use an adapted version of a model trained through the MapReader pipeline to classify various plant structures (i.e. flowers, leaves, seed pods) at patch level, and examined how the abundance and distribution of these different structures change over time as plants grow.
