​
The Alan Turing Institute and its subsidiaries (“we” or “the Turing”) are committed to ensuring transparency in our use of personal information.
This notice explains how we collect and use your personal information when:
Due to the nature of our work as a research institute, we may also process personal information for research projects. This will not be the case for the typical site user, and is more likely to apply to the data we collect through our platforms. However, because it is not always possible for us to proactively provide a privacy notice to those individuals, we also explain below how we process information when we carry out research.
This notice is not intended to cover those who are engaged or employed by us in their engaged/employed capacity and a separate privacy notice will apply to them.
The Alan Turing Institute is a registered charity in England and Wales (charity number 1162533) and a company limited by guarantee, incorporated in England (number 9512457) which is based at the British Library, 96 Euston Road, London NW1 2DB. We also have a subsidiary, Turing Innovation Limited.
If you have any questions about this notice or how we handle your personal information, please contact [email protected].
 
When we use the phrase ‘personal information’ we mean any information that relates to you. At its simplest, this could be your name or email address. It could also include the content of any communications you have with us.
 
We may collect personal information:
 
We may collect, store and use the following categories of personal information about you:
Certain categories of information are sensitive and need more protection (for example, information about race, ethnicity, or health, as well as information about criminal convictions). We do not usually collect these categories of information for a typical site visitor. Where we collect this information we will explain our purposes for using this data and we will ask for your consent. You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time (see below for more information). If you withhold or withdraw consent this will not affect your use of the services.
We might separately collect these categories of information for a research project, but only if we have a valid reason for doing so and only if the law allows us to. For example, the law may allow us to use this information where it is substantially in the public interest and where we have protections in place to safeguard your information and your rights.
 
We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to.  Most commonly, we will use your personal information:
We may (less commonly) use your personal information:
Where we rely on legitimate interests, our legitimate interests include:
 
We use your personal information to:
Or for another reason if that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
 
As a research institute, we may use personal information in ways which involve ‘automated decision making’ and which might constitute ‘profiling’; however, we do not typically do this in ways which will have a significant legal effect on you – for example, to assess your creditworthiness.
We do not make automated decisions based on any particularly sensitive personal information, unless it is justified in the public interest, in which case we will put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights.
When you use our sites, we may use the information collected to profile you. This is done to help us monitor the demographics of individuals who are engaging with certain materials where such monitoring is considered to be essential to the core aims of the relevant site - for example to meet our aim of engaging with a diverse cross section of our community in steering projects.
 
We sometimes share information with other organisations, including other entities in our group, partner universities, founding members, research partners, and service providers.
We will share your information with third parties where required by law or where we have a legitimate interest in doing so.
Where we share information with other ‘controllers’ (organisations who will use the information for their own purposes, rather than to provide services to us) they are responsible to you for their use of your information and compliance with the law. We share information with other controllers such as:  founding members; research partners; project sponsors; HMRC; Charity Commission; and our professional advisers. We share the information in a secure way and take appropriate steps to ensure the recipient protects it.
We may also need to share your personal information in the context of the possible merger, restructuring or expansion of the Institute or our subsidiaries.
Where permitted by law, we may share the personal information collected through our sites with carefully selected partners and parties who collaborate with us on projects.
We do this so that: we can demonstrate our understanding of the diversity of our sites’ communities; to improve our sites;  to run events that will be of relevance to the interests of the communities that use our sites; and so that we can be transparent and held accountable in relation to the commitments we have made to promote diversity and inclusion in our projects.
We will always limit the data we share to what is necessary to achieve these purposes and we will apply measures with the aim of anonymising the data we share so that it will be difficult to trace back to you, such as removing direct identifiers and aggregating data before sharing.
For example, for the AI Standards Hub our partners would include: The British Standards Institution (“BSI”); the National Physical Laboratory (“NPL”) and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (“DCMS”). For more information on how they will handle your data and how to contact them, please see their privacy notices that can be found by clicking the links below:
 
We are based in the UK. Generally, we hold personal information on servers located within the UK. However, we do use suppliers that operate around the world, which means it is possible that personal information we collect from you may be stored outside of the UK or the EU. Some of our sites may have servers outside of the UK or EU.
Certain countries outside the UK have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security protections and fewer rights for individuals. Where your personal information is transferred outside the UK to a country which does not offer similar protection, we put in place appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and respects UK data protection laws (such as requiring the recipients to enter into contracts which have been approved by the relevant UK authorities for this purpose).
 
We have put in place suitable technical and organisational measures to protect the security of your information. Details of these measures are available from [email protected]. These measures include limiting access to your personal information to those individuals who have a business need to know.
 
We keep your personal information for as long as we reasonably need to use it for the reasons set out in this notice (see section 6 above). Typically, this will include the period for which the personal information is actively in use, plus up to 7 years, which is the time that the information may be relevant for the establishment or defence of legal claims.
Where a minimum retention period is required by law (such as retaining records for HMRC purposes) we comply with that minimum period plus up to 12 months to allow time for us to anonymise or delete information in accordance with our internal data management processes.
We may also keep personal information for longer where we are processing it for scientific or historical research purposes.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you.
 
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
To exercise any of the above rights, please contact [email protected].
These are legal rights, so they only apply in certain circumstances and are subject to exemptions.
We may also need to take steps to confirm your identity. This is another security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
If you have concerns about the way we are handling your personal information, you also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/.
 
We may update this notice. If we make substantial changes, we will bring these to your attention where reasonably possible. Otherwise, you can access the latest version of this notice on our main website.
 
If you have any questions about this privacy notice, please contact [email protected].
