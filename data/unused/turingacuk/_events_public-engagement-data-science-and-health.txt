Everyone is welcome to this online event, but the target audience is clinicians, policymakers and health data science researchers. We hope that attendees will learn about the challenges of defining multiple long term conditions and strategies that can be applied to their respective areas of work.
Here’s a description of the session:
Trustworthy data science depends on engagement with patients and the public- the communities who are affected by data science and digital tools used in healthcare and health research.
Datasets, digital tools and analytics need to be designed for – and with – diverse populations, so they don’t only work for some groups at the expense of others.
Our speaker from Wellcome Trust will share three examples of different approaches to engaging with patients and the public:
