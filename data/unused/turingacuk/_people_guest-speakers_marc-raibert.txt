Marc Raibert is Founder and Chairman of Boston Dynamics, a company that creates some of the world’s most advanced dynamic robots, such as BigDog, Atlas, Spot and Handle.  These robots are inspired by the remarkable ability of animals to move with agility, dexterity, perception and intelligence.  A key ingredient of these robots is their dynamic behavior, which contributes to their effectiveness and versatility in the real world.  Before starting Boston Dynamics, Raibert was Professor of Computer Science and Robotics at MIT and Carnegie Mellon.  While at CMU and MIT Raibert founded the Leg Laboratory, a lab that helped establish the scientific basis for highly dynamic robots and that set the stage for the work done at Boston Dynamics.   Raibert is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
