Kin K. Leung received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of California, Los Angeles. He worked AT&T Bell Labs and its successor companies in New Jersey for 19 years. Since 2004, he has been the Tanaka Chair Professor in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), and Computing Departments at Imperial College. He is the Head of Communications and Signal Processing Group in the EEE Department at Imperial. His research focuses on networking, protocols, optimization and modeling of wireless broadband, sensor and ad-hoc networks. He also works on multi-antenna systems and cross-layer optimization of these networks.
He received the Distinguished Member of Technical Staff Award from AT&T Bell Labs in 1994, and was a co-recipient of the 1997 Lanchester Prize Honorable Mention Award.  He was elected as an IEEE Fellow in 2001.  He received the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merits Award from 2004 to 2009 and became a member of Academia Europaea in 2012. Along with his co-authors, he also received best paper awards at major conferences, including the IEEE ICC 2019, ICDCS 2013 and PIMRC 2012. He was a member (2009-11) and the chairman (2012-15) of the IEEE Fellow Evaluation Committee for Communications Society. He has served on the editorial boards for 10 leading technical journals.
