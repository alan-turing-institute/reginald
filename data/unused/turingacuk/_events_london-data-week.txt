From choosing the best Tube route to online shopping, data is part of our everyday lives as Londoners, and data can help us address big challenges in our city, like climate change and the cost of living.  
We want London to be the best city in the world; one where data is used to shape better, happier, healthier lives. We want data to be created, shared and used openly and fairly by everyone, from community groups and charities to businesses and the public sector. 
London is already a great place to use data, and we celebrate that: world-leading businesses using data or AI were created in London, by Londoners. There are 40 fantastic universities and research institutes across the city conducting transformative, interdisciplinary research in data science and AI. And at its heart are nine million smart and creative Londoners who make our city what it is. 
So, the Turing and the London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI) are delighted to present: London Data Week. From 3 to 9 July, there’ll be a great variety of fun and collaborative events tailor-made to bring together the people of London to inspire and empower them to be a part of shaping the city's future.  
Join us this July to imagine and create the future London. 
Visit the London Data Week website to find out more and see what events are on near you.
For more info and the week's agenda – including a brilliant variety of workshops, comedy events, cycling challenges and more - visit the London Data Week website.
Each day there’ll be something different. We want to make sure everyone can take part in something, so different events will take place at different times throughout the week, with some all day, some in the evenings and some in the mornings or afternoons.  
We welcome participation from all backgrounds. Visit the London Data Week website to find out more and register for individual events.
