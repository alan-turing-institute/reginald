This event will be on the theme of AI to Clinical Practice. Despite advancements in the AI space, we are still seeing limited uptake and use of algorithms and tools in clinical practice. This event will explore current opportunities and challenges around bringing digital solutions to clinical healthcare.
We will be hearing from Konstanty Korski, Research and Development Lead, Digital Pathology at Roche and Nicholas Fuggle, Clinician, Associate Professor in Rheumatology at the University of Southampton and co-organiser of the Turing Clinical AI Interest Group.
Konstanty's talk will be on computer vision based algorithms. In the last couple of years, there has been an exponential increase of publications covering the development of different algorithms in this area, especially in the medical field. However, despite such impressive progress there are still disproportionately few solutions that have reached the market and become wildly adopted products. There are several reasons for that discrepancy and they will be discussed in the talk. 
Nick’s talk will introduce the Clinical AI Interest Group and highlight some of his research in musculoskeletal computer vision. The Clinical AI Interest Group is celebrating its first anniversary and has three main aims:
Nick’s research focuses on the diseases of musculoskeletal ageing including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and sarcopenia, and in this session he will focus on the deployment of computer vision in the analysis of bone microarchitecture.
