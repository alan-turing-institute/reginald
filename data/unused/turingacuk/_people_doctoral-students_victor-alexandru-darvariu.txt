Victor-Alexandru Darvariu was a doctoral student at University College London and The Alan Turing Institute. Before starting his graduate studies, he gained his MSci Computer Science with an Industrial Year degree at the University of Birmingham, a year of which he spent working as a Software Engineer in the information security division of Morgan Stanley. Victor previously held Research Assistant posts at both UCL and Birmingham, working on several projects in the data science realm, and interned as a Research Scientist with Spotify in 2021, where he worked on large-scale graph problems. 
 
Many systems can be conceptually thought of as networks: from the complex web of social interactions humans engage in every day to much of the infrastructure that powers our society. Victor aims to develop a framework for reasoning about these systems and to examine applications in areas such as communication, transportation, and social networks. He draws on techniques from the fields of network science, machine learning (with a particular focus on reinforcement learning), and artificial intelligence more broadly. He works under the guidance of Professor Mirco Musolesi and Professor Steve Hailes.
