Online learning is expanding rapidly in UK secondaries. Thousands of pupils and teachers login daily to online learning platforms to access content and engage in learning activities, creating unprecedented amounts of data. How can we use such data to help young learners develop strong language and writing skills?
This workshop will explore how data science might build on the rapid expansion of online learning platforms in UK schools to improve the language development and writing skills of students in the humanities and languages in the UK state school sector. Academics, together with teachers and the educational industry will explore how to frame a partnership for data sharing and educational AI applications in order to support language and literacy and improve outcomes in the UK state school sector.
The workshop will include research talks and a panel discussion, followed by break-out sessions where participants consider the areas where big data from schools and writing analytics could help improve learning outcomes in language and literacy as well as questions around ethical data sharing and privacy and research infrastructure. We expect contributions from researchers in natural language processing, machine learning, writing analytics, linguistics and education as well as stakeholders, e.g. the Chartered College of Teaching, the National Subject Association for English as an Additional Language (NALDIC), the Royal College of Speech Therapists and industry providers.
The workshop is open to researchers in data science, language and education, secondary school teachers and managers, government, educational companies, assessment bodies and educational charities.
There are two ways to join the workshop: in-person at Murray Edwards College in Cambridge, or online via Zoom. Registration is essential.
