The Turing is committed to supporting its students to get the most out of their Enrichment experience and increasing access to the scheme. We are always open to discuss individual circumstances and make reasonable adjustments for students. This page gives information on how we support students on the Enrichment scheme.
On the 25 January at 12:30 we are offering an Enrichment Application Webinar to help students with writing their application. The webinar will feature members of the Academic Recruitment Team at the Turing as well as members of our research community who review applications. We’ll discuss:
This webinar is open to all potential applicants and will be held on Tuesday 25 January 12:30-13:30. Sign up is now open via Zoom. If you can’t make it, don’t worry, we’ll share all the resources plus a recording after the event.
To support the additional costs that come with an Enrichment Placement Award, the Turing offers a stipend of £450 a month. This can be used flexibly to cover relocation costs or commuting from your current home. Unlike previous years, this is now offered as a flat rate to all students on a Placement Award. 
Awards are paid to the student through the university, which is why we suggest you speak to your university before applying
Please contact us at [email protected] or on 0203 862 3578 if you would like to discuss this further.
For information on the Turing's guidelines for Enrichment students on attendance and leave, including parental leave and sick leave, you can view our current guidelines. Please be aware these guidelines will be updated annually so may change before you start your placement. 
As part of our commitment to inclusion, we recognise that some groups face additional barriers to participating in the Enrichment scheme. For this reason we offer an Access Fund to support students to participate who otherwise would not be able to due to a disability, caring responsibility or financial hardship. The fund provides expenses awards of up to £500 per month.
Students with caring responsibilities may for example choose to use the fund to support additional childcare costs, or a student with a disability may use the fund to secure appropriate accommodation or support while on placement.
You can apply for the fund on the application form. Applications will be assessed separately by the Student Services Team and will not be seen by reviewers. For more details please see our FAQs.
We want to ensure all our students are well supported at the Turing. This requires students to share relevant information with us about what they need support with. Please be assured that anything you do share will be treated in confidence. We encourage candidates to let us know about any reasonable adjustments they may require for the application process or their placement. You may already know what you would like to request, or you may like to have a general discussion of your options.
There are opportunities to share this information on your application form and at the onboarding stage if you are offered a place. This information will not be seen by reviewers or panels assessing applications. You can also contact us at any time to discuss adjustments at [email protected] or on 0203 862 3578.
We have dedicated academic services support to provide help and advice throughout your time with us including weekly drop-in sessions. Enrichment students have access to our Employee Assistance Programme which provides a 24-hour telephone helpline among other things.
For research advice academic mentors and members of the Research Engineering Group can be approached for support and advice. The Turing can also offer support in finding accommodation by signposting students to useful sources of advice and accommodation.
