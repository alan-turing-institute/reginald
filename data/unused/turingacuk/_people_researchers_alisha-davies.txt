Alisha Davies is the Health Theme Lead for the AI for science and government (ASG) programme at the Turing. She has a PhD in epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and holds an Hon Professorship in the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences at Swansea University. Alisha is also an NHS Consultant in Public Health and Head of Research and Evaluation at Public Health Wales where she leads a multi-disciplinary division working alongside academic partners to address knowledge gaps in public health policy and practice. Examples include using linked routine health data to explore patterns of mental health in children and young people, national surveys to address digital exclusion in health, and social science methods to sustain community resilience.
Alisha is also a member of the NIHR Public Health Research Prioritisation Committee, Deputy Director of the Centre for Population Health Research in Wales and leads the Health Foundation funded Wales Networked Data Lab.
Alisha is primarily interested in health inequalities and the wider determinants of health. Her research career spans mental and physical health – from health care through to the wider determinants such as employment and digital exclusion.
She is interested in the application of AI and data science to the complexity of health, how such advances in science can have an impact in practice and policy decisions, to help us to address the drivers of health and inequalities.
