An event series for Turing-Roche partnership updates, knowledge sharing and new perspectives. Find out more about the series.
 
This event will be on the theme of AI in precision/personalised medicine. We will explore how AI's insights may help each patient's unique needs and empower clinician decision-making.
We'll be hearing from Dr Samaneh Abbasi, Senior Data Scientist and Data Science Network Co-Lead on the PHC Data analytics and Imaging (DAI) team at Roche and Professor Zoe Kourtzi, Professor of Cognitive Computational Neuroscience at the University of Cambridge and Turing University Lead.
 
Samaneh will be speaking about automatic detection of molecular subtypes as one of the prognostic factors in breast cancer directly from H&E images, while in clinics IHC staining is usually used to determine this factor.
 
Zoe will be discussing the EDoN initiative which brings together global experts in data science, digital technology and neurodegeneration to develop a digital tool for the early detection of diseases that cause dementia.
 
We also hope to have discussions about this area pre and post the event via our Turing-Roche Slack Workspace which you can join here.
