Clíodhna is leading delivery of the multi-agency advisory service project, which brings regulatory and health technology assessment partners together to provide joined-up guidance and advice to developers and adopters of these technologies, and has developed the AI & Digital Regulations Service. She has also served on funding award panels for AI technologies, and chaired the award panels for round 3 of the NHS AI Award last year (phases 3-4). Previously, Clíodhna worked on a broad range of national innovation programmes, including real-world evaluation and led the development of the NHS Innovation Service, a single front door for innovators to the NHS. Her health-innovation policy work is informed by her frontline experience, as she worked in mental health and acute services within the UK and in supply chain operations in South Africa.
