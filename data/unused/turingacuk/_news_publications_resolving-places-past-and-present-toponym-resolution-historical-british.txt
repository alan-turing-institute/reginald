Newspapers and their metadata are richly geographical, not only in their distribution but also their content. Attending to these spatial features is a prerequisite in newspaper research. Following other projects to have geoparsed place names in newspapers, we describe our approach to linking historical geospatial information in text to real-world locations which 1) adopts an expansive definition of what counts as a locatable entity; 2) uses knowledge bases derived from contemporaneous sources; and 3) leverages contextual information to disambiguate hard-to-locate places. This method depends on combining historical and non-historical resources and the paper discusses the potential benefits for humanities research.
