Jon Rowe is Professor of Natural Computation in the School of Computer Science, and Deputy Pro-Vice Chancellor (Strategic Projects) at the University of Birmingham. He is Programme Director for the Data Science for Science and Humanities programme at The Alan Turing Institute, and is PI and Chair of the SPF funded AI for science and government project. He is an Associate Editor for Theoretical Computer Science journal. He joined the University of Birmingham in 2000 and his PhD in Artificial Intelligence is from the University of Exeter.
Jon's research encompasses the theoretical analysis of nature-inspired algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithms and other randomised search heuristics, along with a range of inter-disciplinary applications from modelling social crowd dynamics to chemical reaction networks to medical imaging techniques.
