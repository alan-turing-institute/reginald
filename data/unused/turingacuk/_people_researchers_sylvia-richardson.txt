Professor Sylvia Richardson is Director of the MRC Biostatistics Unit and holds the Chair of Biostatistics in the University of Cambridge since 2012. Prior to this, she was Directeur de Recherches at the French National Institute for Medical Research. In 2000, she moved to the UK to take up the Chair of Biostatistics at Imperial College. She was awarded the Guy Medal in Silver from the Royal Statistical Society in 2009. She is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis and was elected Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2016.
She has worked extensively on statistical methodology and applications to the health sciences. Her main interest is centred on modelling and computational aspects of Bayesian statistics applied to complex-highly structured biological and epidemiological data sets. Her recent research has focussed on the analysis of large data problems such as those arising in genomics and on developing methods and scalable algorithms for clustering, sparse regression and large scale hierarchical analysis of high dimensional biomedical and multi-omics data.
