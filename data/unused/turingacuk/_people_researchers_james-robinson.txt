James is a Senior Research Software Engineer at The Alan Turing Institute. He has a PhD in particle physics from UCL where he worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. He continued working on ATLAS through postdocs at the University of Manchester and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchroton (DESY) in Hamburg.
In each of these positions, he was heavily involved in the analysis of the large and complex datasets generated by the collider, as well as pioneering new methods for calibrating the detector itself.
James is a co-investigator of the Data safe havens in the cloud project where he has developed an open-source, reproducible cloud-solution for securely analysing sensitive data.
