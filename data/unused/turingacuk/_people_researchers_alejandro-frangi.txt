Alejandro (Alex) was born in La Plata, Argentina. In 1991, he moved to Barcelona, Spain, where he obtained his undergraduate degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia (Barcelona) in 1996. Then he researched electrical impedance tomography for image reconstruction and noise characterisation at the same institution under a CIRIT grant. In 1997, he obtained a grant from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs to pursue his PhD in Medicine at the Image Sciences Institute of the University Medical Centre Utrecht on model-based cardiovascular image analysis. During this period, he was visiting researcher at the Imperial College in London, UK, and in Philips Medical Systems BV, The Netherlands.
Prof Frangi is Diamond Jubilee Chair in Computational Medicine at the University of Leeds, UK, with joint appointments at the School of Computing and the School of Medicine. He is also Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies, focusing on Precision Computational Medicine for In Silico Trials of Medical Devices. He is the Scientific Director of the Leeds Centre for HealthTech Innovation, a joint initiative from the University of Leeds and the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, and the Director of Research and Innovation of the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. During 2001-2020, he founded and directed the Centre for Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine. Prof Frangi has visiting positions at KU Leuven, the Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, CNITECH Chinese Academy of Science (Ningbo), the Zhejiang University of Technology (Hangzhou), Shenzhen University (Shenzhen), and Beijing Institute of Technology (Beijing).
Professor Frangi's main research interests lie at the crossroad of medical image analysis and modelling, emphasising machine learning (phenomenological models) and computational physiology (mechanistic models). He has a particular interest in statistical methods applied to population imaging and in silico clinical trials. He is also interested in physics informed deep learning and, more generally, integrating prior knowledge in otherwise data-driven approaches. His highly interdisciplinary work has been translated to the areas of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurosciences. He has been the principal investigator or scientific coordinator of over 25 national and European projects funded by public and private bodies totalling over £50m.
Prof Frangi edited several books and editorial articles and over 260 journal papers in key international journals of his research field. He has been times Guest Editor of special issues of IEEE Trans Med Imaging, IEEE Trans Biomed Eng, and Medical Image Analysis journals. He was chair of the 3rd International Conference on Functional Imaging and Modelling of the Heart (FIMH05) held in Barcelona in June 2005, Publications Chair of the IEEE International Symposium in Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2006), Programme Committee Member of various editions of the Intl Conf on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) (Brisbane, AU, 2007; Beijing CN, 2010; Toronto CA 2011; Nice FR 2012; Nagoya JP 2013), International Liaison of ISBI 2009, Tutorials Co-Chair of MICCAI 2010, and Programme Co-chair of MICCAI 2015. He was also General Chair for ISBI 2012 held in Barcelona and General Chair of MICCAI 2018 held in Granada, Spain. He will be General Chair of Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI) in 2023 in Bariloche, Argentina.
