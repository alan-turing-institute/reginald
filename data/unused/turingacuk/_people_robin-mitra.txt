Robin Mitra is an ONS Senior Lecturer in Statistics at Cardiff University and Research Theme Lead in Structured Missingness for the Turing-Roche Partnership. Prior to his appointment at Cardiff University he was a Lecturer at Lancaster University and prior to that a Lecturer at the University of Southampton.
He enjoys working collaboratively, both with colleagues in academia as well as with non-academic partners. Some of his previous collaborations have included working with the Office for National Statistics and the National Health Service Blood and Transplant as well as the Institute of Employment Research in Germany.
He is an active member of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) and was the Chair of the Medical Section from January 2017- January 2020 and is currently a RSS Council member. 
 
His main research areas are dealing with problems arising due to missing data and data confidentiality. He also has interests in Bayesian methods more generally.
