The Turing-Roche strategic partnership was established in summer 2021. The goal of this five-year partnership in advanced analytics between the two organisations is our North Star: 'enabling the generation of insights to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes at an unprecedented level of precision in order to improve clinical care'. Our partnership will cover multiple activities to investigate how and why diseases affect people differently and why they may respond differently to treatments.
This knowledge share series aims to bring together members of both Roche and Turing's networks, as well as the wider scientific community, to showcase partnership updates and research, knowledge share and hear different academic and industry perspectives on data science topics to gain insight and help build new connections and collaborations.
This series will be loosely based around areas related to our North Star but we also want to explore other areas of data science that are of mutual interest to Roche, The Alan Turing Institute and beyond – so everyone is welcome.
Join the Turing-Roche Slack Workspace. 
If you are interested in being a speaker at one of our events or want to give feedback on a knowledge share event, then please do get in touch with Vicky Hellon, Community Manager for the partnership ([email protected])
