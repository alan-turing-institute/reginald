Louise is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute. She holds a degree in physics from Imperial College London and recently completed her DPhil in computational biology at the University of Oxford, where she specialised in the simulation of complex biological systems. Her particular area of interest was in cardiac electrophysiology modelling, and in demonstrating how such in silico approaches could be utilised to streamline the safety assessment process for new pharmaceutical compounds.
Since joining the Turing, she is looking forward to building upon her experience with mechanistic models and exploring how machine learning approaches can be used to investigate larger-scale problems.
