Andrea is a third year PhD student in Mathematics at Queen Mary University of London and an enrichment student at The Alan Turing Institute. Before joining Queen Mary, Andrea studied applied mathematics at the University of Catania, Italy (both BSc and MSc). He was also a student of the Scuola Superiore di Catania, a public institution that provides university students with advanced additional courses. During his Masters, he did two internships in the Complex Systems and Networks Research Group at Queen Mary. He also worked on evolutionary algorithms for solar cell design and synthetic biology problems.
Andrea's current research interests cover several aspects of complex networks, with a special focus on multi-layer networks and their applications to large-scale systems. His PhD project aims to develop new measures, based on optimisation principles and information theory techniques, in order to extract relevant features from large-scale multi-layer networks.
