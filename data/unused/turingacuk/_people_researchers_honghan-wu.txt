Dr Honghan Wu is an associate professor at Institute of Health Informatics, UCL. He holds a PhD in Computing Science. His current research interest is in using text technologies and Knowledge Graph techniques to analyse health data. He leads a health informatics group (https://knowlab.github.io/) and co-leads Edinburgh Clinical NLP group (https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/clinical-natural-language-processing).
Dr Wu plays technical leadership roles in several Health Data Research UK funded initiatives including National Text Analytics project. He works closely with National Health Service (NHS) organisations across the UK to use artificial intelligence technologies in supporting research and health service improvements. He has been applying abovementioned information technologies in tackling challenges in managing and treating mental disorders, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, he is studying clusters of diseases (multimorbidity), particularly in elderlies.
