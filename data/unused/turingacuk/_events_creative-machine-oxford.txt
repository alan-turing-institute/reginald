Creative Machine Oxford is a prestigious symposium and showcase of the latest creative and research applications of artificial intelligence (AI) at the intersection of AI and creativity across the domains of digital art, neuroscience, scientific discovery and music.
 
The Symposium has been developed by Goldsmiths, University of London, in partnership with Jesus College Oxford, and is generously supported by The Alan Turing Institute. 
The event brings together leading experts from the worlds of computing, AI, art, robotics, and virtual and augmented reality, including speakers from King.com, Deepmind, Oxford Computational Neurosciences, MIT Technology Review, Spotify, and the V&A, for a day of talks and networking opportunities themed around AI and creativity. Explore topics such as ‘AI and visualisation in scientific discovery’, ‘Can AI be creative?’ and ‘Curating AI and digital art’. There will be demonstrations of some of the latest creative AI technologies, and a digital art exhibition, plus a keynote panel discussion on the impact and implications to society of AI in the 21st century, hosted by Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt, Jesus College Principal and Professorial Research Fellow in Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
Co-Chairs are Prof William Latham, Prof Frederic Fol Leymarie, Dr.Janina Schupp and Dr. Steve Taylor.
The event is free to attend, and open to all members of the Alan Turing Institute.
