In this talk, Stephen Friend will propose a way of using smartphones and wearable technology to help in the care of those with chronic conditions, such as Parkinson’s, diabetes, arthritis, and dementia. Stephen suggests giving those suffering from these conditions the chance to pause, reflect and share, in order to build a system of guidance and support based on direct objective data with insights by and for each other. When augmented by an AI approach, this data could enable the forecasting of symptom changes for individuals and offer health guidance that rests on empowerment. This approach is well suited to the care of those with chronic conditions in the UK, and in very low resource areas worldwide.
The talk will be followed by a Q&A session and a complimentary drinks reception.
