Miguel Rodrigues is a Professor of Information Theory and Processing at University College London. He also leads the Information, Inference and Machine Learning Lab that focuses on the foundations and applications of information theory, information processing, and machine learning systems.
He held various appointments with various institutions worldwide including Cambridge University, Princeton University, Duke University, and the University of Porto, Portugal. He obtained the undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, Portugal and the PhD degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from University College London.
Dr Rodrigues serves or has served as Editor of IEEE BITS, Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, and Lead Guest Editor of the Special Issue on “Information-Theoretic Methods in Data Acquisition, Analysis, and Processing” of the IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing.
Miguel's research lies in the general area of mathematics of information, information theory, and information processing.
He will work on a variety of topics at the Turing including: (1) information-theoretic foundations of privacy (2) information-theoretic foundations of security and (3) information-theoretic foundations of deep learning algorithms.
