Nijesh is an enthusiastic researcher currently engaged in doctoral studies at the University of Edinburgh, with a specific focus on Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI). With a background in cognitive science, mathematics, and neuroscience, he brings a multidisciplinary approach to his research. His primary focus lies in developing computational frameworks and novel approaches that bridge the gap between neural learning and symbolic reasoning. By integrating these two domains, he aims to create AI systems that are verifiable and interpretable in applied settings. Nijesh is driven by the belief that transparent AI models are essential for building trust and enabling wider adoption of AI technologies. 
Nijesh’s research journey has been enriched by valuable experiences at various institutions. At the Picower Institute at MIT, he delved into the fascinating intersection of neuroscience and AI, gaining valuable insights into the inner workings of the brain and its connection to intelligent systems. Additionally, his time at the HCI lab at UW-Madison exposed him to the principles of human-centered design and interaction, highlighting the significance of creating AI systems that are intuitive and user-friendly. These experiences have fueled Nijesh’s curiosity and sparked his interest in exploring the potential of Neuro-Symbolic AI. By combining the power of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of symbolic approaches, he aspires to unlock new possibilities and applications in the field of AI.
