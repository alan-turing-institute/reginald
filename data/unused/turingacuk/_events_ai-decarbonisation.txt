The Alan Turing Institute is pleased to host this important and timely online seminar on AI for decarbonisation in collaboration with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). 
This morning event connects industry decision makers with world-leading researchers, to explore current efforts in and the potential for AI in decarbonisation. Presentations and discussion will be themed on machine learning in energy industry design, electricity systems, digital twins and transport & logistics. 
Please note this event will take place online, due to the RMT Union Rail Strikes taking place in early November. 

 
Welcome and introduction
Research applications and case studies
Facilitated conversation between audience and researchers
 
 
The event will take place online on a browser-based platform. You must register to receive the joining information. 
Final joining information, including the link to join the event, will be sent the day before to your registered email address only.
