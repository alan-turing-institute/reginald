World Environment Day (WED) is celebrated annually on 5th June and encourages awareness and action for the protection of the environment.
We invite you to join us in exploring environmental Data Science and AI research and its applications of the present and future. Unpacking the environmental issues that affect us all, the day will feature research into sustainability and the environment.
Topics to be discussed are the existing and prospective challenges we face of our Global to Local Environment Exploration (GLEE) and the critical need to invest in a sustainable future, maximise all our research capabilities and examine the environment we create, work and live in. Please join us to discuss with some of the UK's leading Data Science & AI researchers and create connections in this rapidly expanding, cross-disciplinary landscape.
We encourage all UK Universities wanting to expand their Data Science and AI Network and who are looking to join the Alan Turing Institute University Network in 2023, to join us. You can make connections with colleagues, researchers and meet potential new partners from a national ecosystem and of course, ask questions.
