Michael is Director of Foundational AI Research. His work at the Turing involves developing the AI programme, focusing in particular on multi-agent systems. He is also a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. He has been an AI researcher for more than 30 years, and has published more than 400 scientific articles on the subject.
 
Michael's main research interests are the in field of multi-agent systems, and his current focus is on developing techniques for understanding the dynamics of multi-agent systems. His research draws on ideas from game theory, logic, computational complexity, and agent-based modelling. 
Michael is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of AI (AAAI), and a Fellow of the the European Association for AI (EurAI). From 2014-16, he was President of the European Association for AI,  from 2015-17 he was President of the International Joint Conference on AI (IJCAI), and from 2007-09 he was President of the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (IFAAMAS). In 2006, he received the ACM SIGART Autonomous Agents Research Award, given annually to an individual whose research has been particularly influential in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. He has been the recipient of the AAMAS "best paper" award three times (in 2008, 2009, and 2011).
