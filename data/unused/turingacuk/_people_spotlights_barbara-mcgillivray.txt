I aim to better understand and track how words change meaning over time. This can be over long time periods – centuries for languages like Ancient Greek or Latin – right down to just a few years in the case of Twitter data, for example.
Language changes constantly, and words can have different meanings at different points in time. It also depends on our context, who we speak to, and where we come from. Getting an algorithm to understand all these complexities is hard!
Language change not only interests computational linguists and data scientists, but also digital humanists, historians, classicists and social scientists, so I often find myself in projects with people from different disciplinary backgrounds. It’s really challenging and rewarding to engage with questions that these different communities are passionate about.
Becoming Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Open Humanities Data. Having previously worked in academic publishing, and now working full-time in research, it’s great to be in the position to help make a difference towards an open-data culture in the humanities.
Interdisciplinary. Computational. Humanistic.
I enjoy dancing Argentine tango - which I’ve been doing for fifteen years.
The Language Log is a language blog maintained by Mark Liberman at the University of Pennsylvania. It’s a great way into linguistics matters for non-specialists.
One I like is the evolution of the meaning of the words silly and nice, which originally had opposite meanings to what they have today. Silly originally meant ‘blessed’ or ‘happy’ coming from an old Germanic root meaning ‘luck, happiness’, but over time it went through a series of changes from ‘blessed’ to ‘pious’, to ‘helpless’, ‘innocent’ to ‘pitiable’ to ‘feeble’ to today’s meaning of ’foolish’. Nice, on the other hand, coming ultimately from Latin nescire ‘to be ignorant’ went from meaning ‘ignorant’ through ‘foolish’, ‘shy’, ‘lascivious, ‘extravagant’, ‘elegant’, and finally ‘pleasant, agreeable’, thus. So be careful who you call nice or silly!
