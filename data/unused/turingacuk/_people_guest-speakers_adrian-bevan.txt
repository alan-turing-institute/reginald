Adrian Bevan is Head of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Queen Mary University of London. He uses a variety of data science techniques for his day-to day research in order to learn about the sub-atomic nature of particles. His research interests include understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe and developing a deeper understanding of the Higgs boson. He also works on the development of semiconductor sensor devices for operation in novel experiments and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
Adrian currently participates in Big Data-based experiments at international laboratories and specialises in parameter estimation through complex modelling and simulation of data. Adrian has almost two decades of experience in this area. He has worked on experiments at international laboratories in Switzerland (CERN and PSI), the US (SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) and CERN (Switzerland). Many of the research topics of interest have significant amounts of background "noise" obscuring the signal and as a result Adrian has had to use machine learning techniques in order to identify signal for subsequent analysis. He has also written a book on Statistical Data Analysis and edited a book on The Physics of the B Factories.
