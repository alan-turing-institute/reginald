Assurance is a process of building trust and justified confidence in a system or technology through engagement and communication. Trustworthy and ethical assurance is a process and structured methodology for communicating the basis for how ethical goals, such as fairness and explainability, have been operationalised and implemented throughout the project lifecycle of a digital and data-driven technology—specifically, those that use some form of machine learning or artificial intelligence.
This collaborative project between the Assuring Autonomy International Programme (University of York) and the Alan Turing Institute seeks to build on and harmonise existing research and work in trustworthy and ethical assurance, including the development of open and reproducible tools that help project teams meet ethical and regulatory best practices in health research and healthcare for a range of digital and data-driven technologies.
Trustworthy and ethical assurance is a procedure for developing a structured argument, which provides reviewable (and contestable) assurance that a set of claims about the ethical properties of a data-driven technology are warranted given the available evidence.
This definition captures three important and interlocking components of trustworthy assurance:

Figure 1: a schematic showing the three interlocking components that support trustworthy and ethical assurance.
The SAFE-D Principles are a set of ethical principles developed within the Ethics Team (Public Policy Programme) to serve as starting points for reflection and deliberation about possible harms and benefits associated with data-driven technologies. The acronym, ‘SAFE-D’ stands for the following ethical principles:
The SAFE-D principles provide high-level normative goals, which can be specified and operationalised throughout a project’s lifecycle to support the identification and evaluation of core attributes that require assurance - find out more about the SAFE-D principles. Argument patterns can be developed for each of the SAFE-D principles to support context-specific development of assurance cases (e.g. fair digital twins used in healthcare).
Developing trustworthy and ethical assurance cases can be complex. Identifying and evaluating the practical actions undertaken throughout the design, development, and deployment of a project’s lifecycle requires wide-ranging expertise and diverse stakeholder engagement.
The development of our assurance platform seeks to improve the accessibility and usability of the methodology to drive impact and use, especially in digital healthcare where emerging regulation around the use of data-driven technologies can often lead to confusion regarding how to demonstrate and communicate that goals such as fairness have been sufficiently established.
This project has the following objectives:
Key to this project will be the application of the methodology and platform to the specific context of digital healthcare. The project team will use a case study approach to identify exemplary projects to help a) develop the methodology and platform through stakeholder engagement, and b) demonstrate the benefits of the methodology.
This application will support the creation of reusable argument patterns to help researchers and developers know how to communicate and justify how ethical goals have been established in their work, and also help support the emergence of best practices for regulatory compliance.
The project team will work closely with researchers in the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins and the Health programme to identify salient use cases (e.g. digital twins for cardiology).
