Felix-Anselm van Lier is a public law scholar focusing on constitution-making processes and a Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology. He holds degrees in law and anthropology from the universities of Bremen, Turin and the London School of Economics and Political Science. He completed his doctorate at the University of Oxford in 2018. Amongst others, he has worked as a consultant for the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, Democracy Reporting International, the Berghof Foundation, and Lawyers for Justice in Libya.
Felix current work focuses on finding productive ways of harnessing the democratic and deliberative potential of digital technologies to redefine the relationship between state institutions and citizens. He is particularly interested in the impact of such technology on public participation in constitution making and on the institutional and procedural frameworks through which constitutions are created.
