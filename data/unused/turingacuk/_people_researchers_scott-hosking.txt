Scott Hosking leads a team of scientists and engineers across both the British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute who are focused on the development of AI and digital twin technologies for understanding, monitoring and predicting environmental change.
His projects include the intelligent fusion of data from satellite and in-situ surface sensors to help understand our changing planet; probabilistic machine learning for localised climate impacts; AI for seasonal sea ice forecasting and improving climate models; and computer vision toolkits for tracking environmental change and wildlife monitoring.
Scott is also a Co-Director for the Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the Application of AI to the study of Environmental Risks (AI4ER), a £6m UKRI funded programme to train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental science.
