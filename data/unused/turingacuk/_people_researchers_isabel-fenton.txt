Before joining the Turing, Isabel worked as an academic investigating the influence of climate change over the past 40 million years on the diversity and evolution of ocean plankton. She studied for a PhD jointly at the Natural History Museum and Imperial College London. She then worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher first at the Natural History Museum and then at the University of Oxford. 
At the Turing, Isabel is working on the Scivision project, which is creating a tool for discovering and using pre-trained computer vision models and image datasets, from science and the humanities.
