Lydia is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, working as part of the Research Engineering Group. Before joining the Institute, she completed a DPhil at the University of Oxford in Zoology, studying the mechanics of landing flight in birds of prey. Her research interests combine zoology with physics and engineering, with particular focus on natural learning, sensory systems, and animal motion.
At the Turing Lydia's research interests are with open research software, reproducibility in science, and teaching data science best practices. She works with a wide range of researchers in multiple disciplines and universities. She also works on ethical data practices and digital identities, and in open source software projects.
