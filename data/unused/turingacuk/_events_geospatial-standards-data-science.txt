Advances in geospatial technologies have led to a significant increase in the role of geospatial data across sectors such as agriculture, aviation, energy, utilities, hydrology, smart cities, government, health and others. As more geospatial data has been collected and analysed to support these sectors, so has the need increased to enable efficient and effective sharing of geospatial data. International standards are a key enabler of such efficient and effective sharing of data. The aim of this workshop is to examine the growth of geospatial data sources and the international standards that enable these sources to be leveraged by data scientists. The workshop will also explore what geospatial standardisation in Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Discrete Global Grid Systems, Linked Data and other areas will mean for Data Science.
The workshop is being organised in collaboration with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) - an international industry consortium of over 520 companies, government agencies and universities participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geospatial interface standards. Attendees of this workshop will hear about Geospatial Standards for Data Science and also about the role such standards play within the Defence context.
