Polly Hudson is a Senior Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute and project lead for the Colouring Cities Research Programme. She was  previously a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis University College London, where she developed the Colouring Cities concept, and has also been a Visiting Fellow at the Kellogg Centre for the Historic Environment, University of Oxford.
Polly trained as an architectural historian, and worked initially in historic building restoration, museum and exhibition design, and community planning. In 1996 she set up the Building Exploratory charitable trust in London as a prototype for creative, multidisciplinary knowledge sharing centres about building stocks where the first iteration of Colouring London was built and tested. Polly is a member of the ‘Computer Vision and Digital Heritage’ and ‘Facilitating Participation in Data Science ‘special interest groups at Turing and sits on the UK’s Digital Twin Hub Community Council. She has also worked on advisory committees and boards for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, English Heritage, The Royal Institute of British Architects, and the National Lottery.
