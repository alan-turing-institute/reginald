Our ability to understand and control biological systems is being augmented by developments on two fronts: our ability to collect more data describing them, and our capability to comprehend these data using machine learning and AI models. 
 
 
The Universities of Southampton and Exeter are jointly organizing this event with the support of The Alan Turing Institute. The workshop will bring together experts in omic data generation and analysis to discuss the opportunities and difficulties involved in effective biological data integration.  Topics discussed at the event will include the importance of generating suitable data, the requirement for close collaboration between experimental and computational researchers, and the challenges we face to do this fairly and effectively. 
The co-Chairs are Dr Owen Rackham, University of Southampton and Dr Krasi Tsaneva-Atanasova, University of Exeter.
 
In order to encourage a coordinated and curated interdisciplinary engagement between experimental and computational biologists and meet the goals of this workshop, registration for this event will be invitation-only in the first instance. The list of invited applicants includes a number of Turing Fellows and Turing-affiliated researchers. The remaining spaces will be filled through an open invitation. If oversubscribed, the organisers will assess/accept applicants to ensure the goals of the workshop are met.
Interested participants should contact the organiser Susan Davies at [email protected]
The keynote talk by Dr Francesca Nadalin, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), will be live-streamed and open to anyone to attend online. Please register via Eventbrite – the closing date for registration is Tuesday 6 June.
