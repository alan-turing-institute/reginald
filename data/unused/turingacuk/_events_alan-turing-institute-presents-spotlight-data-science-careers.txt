We invite you to join the first talk of our new Spotlight on Data Science Careers series. These talks are part of our ongoing work to increase awareness and knowledge of careers in Data Science and AI.
Through our Spotlight on Data Science Careers talks, we hope to shine a light on the career journeys of data scientists working in government, defence and security and academia and share advice, challenges and successes for those interested in working in these areas.
Dr Johanna Hutchinson, Director of Data and Data Science, Department of Health and Social Care, joins us in an interactive virtual talk to discuss her career journey thus far. 
Dr Johanna Hutchinson is the UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) Director of Analytics & Data Science and Data IQ’s third most influential person in Data (Data IQ 100 The Most Influential People in DATA 2021).
Johanna moved to DHSC in April 2020 and joined the Joint Biosecurity Centre, now part of UKHSA, to build the growing data capability and promote transparency. She is a keen advocate of increased use of data and analysis in public services and has always been a key player in promoting diversity in the workforce.
This event is online only. We welcome participation from all backgrounds, but this event will be of interest to those interested in pursuing Data Science Careers.
