Ilias Moutsopoulos is a first year PhD student reading Bioinformatics at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of Dr Irina Mohorianu. He holds a BA/MA degree in Mathematics and an MSc in Systems Biology, also from the University of Cambridge. 
Ilias has a breadth of experience working on a variety of projects and research topics, both within and outside academia. He also has a keen interest in helping others through open science, volunteering, and mentoring and always strives to make the world a better place.
Coordinated, flexible, yet robust gene regulation is essential in all organisms and ensures the required adaptability for survival. On a systems level, the collection of all regulatory interactions can be represented/summarised in a gene regulatory network (GRN) of genes, transcription factors, and regulatory RNAs.
Ilias uses a variety of approaches to study and compare these networks by applying supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to tackle some of the current issues of GRN identification and classification. He is particularly interested in the effects of noise, network comparison and integration of information from different systems
