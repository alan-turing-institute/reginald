Kristina is a Research Associate in the Data Science for Science programme, where she works on developing cutting-edge AI-driven computer vision tools applied to bioimage analysis.
Kristina first became acquainted with The Turing through her PhD research work in the field of time-lapse microscopy image analysis and single-cell tracking. She is interested in multigenerational cell lineages and time series analysis of single-cell trajectories using computer vision approaches. In particular, Kristina puts emphasis on training deep neural network models which learn meaningful and explainable latent representations of the image data to drive biological discovery.
Prior to her PhD with the London Interdisciplinary Doctoral (LIDo) Programme at UCL, Kristina completed an integrated BSc in Biomedical Science at King’s College London with a year in industry, where she gained practical experience in a biopharmaceutical company in Cambridge, UK. As an undergraduate, she built a diverse repertoire of internship experience in world-renowned biomedical research laboratories, including MIT and Cancer Research UK.
Fascinated by the area of computational biology, Kristina then transitioned into a fully computational bioscience PhD research project and strengthened her skills over her 6-month placement as an AI Research Intern at Microsoft Research Cambridge. Her thesis work yielded multiple outputs, including scientific publications and contributions to collaborative codebases, as well as frequent research talks and poster presentations at national and international conferences, which goes well in line with her passion to travel and explore new regions of the world.
Beyond her research activities, Kristina is passionate about bridging the gap between biomedicine and computer science as well as bringing the science outcomes to the lay audience. She often tweets about her work and the recent advances in her field, and in the past actively contributed to improve the communication of scientific research as a National Delegate at the United Nations’ Youth Assembly and at the European Commission’s international conference series.
Kristina speaks multiple languages (including python), continues to deepen her expertise in other branches of AI, and grows her involvement in various mentoring schemes sharing expertise to navigate the pitfalls of research education.
Away from the computer screen, she is a leisure dancer and enjoys long walks, runs, and taking good care of her body and mind.
