Born and bread in the coast of Catalonia, Guillem graduated in physics at Barcelona and is now doing a PhD at Warwick University. With broad research interests in statistical physics and network theory, his current focus is on the study of human geography from the perspective of complexity science.
With ever growing computing and data-mining power available, complex networks cast light on key properties of many artificial and natural systems. Social systems are not an exception, and in an increasingly urbanized world complex networks provide a global perspective on collective human interactions. In this context, Guillem’s research focuses on networks where nodes are real cities from around the globe, whose sustained interactions give rise to trade, immigration, cultural exchange or war, amongst other phenomena. My aim is to clarify this contact patterns and investigate their relation to the geographical and economical environment of cities.
