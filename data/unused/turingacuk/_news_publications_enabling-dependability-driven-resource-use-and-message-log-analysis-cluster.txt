In the 24th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics (HiPC 2017) http://hipc.org/hipc-2017-accepted-papers-keynote-speakers/
Recent work have used both failure logs and resource use data separately (and together) to detect system failure-inducing errors and to diagnose system failures. System failure occurs as a result of error propagation and the (unsuccessful) execution of error recovery mechanisms. Knowledge of error propagation patterns and unsuccessful error recovery is important for more accurate and detailed failure diagnosis, and knowledge of recovery protocols deployment is important for improving system reliability.
This paper presents the CORRMEXT framework which carries failure diagnosis another significant step forward by analyzing and reporting error propagation patterns and degrees of success and failure of error recovery protocols. CORRMEXT uses both error messages and resource use data in its analyses. Application of CORRMEXT to data from the Ranger supercomputer have produced new insights.
CORRMEXT has: (i) identified correlations between resource use counters that capture recovery attempts after an error, (ii) identified correlations between error events to capture error propagation patterns within the system, (iii) identified error propagation and recovery paths during system execution to explain system behaviour, (iv) showed that the earliest times of change in system behaviour can only be identified by analyzing both the correlated resource use counters and correlated errors. CORRMEXT will be installed on the HPC clusters at the Texas Advanced Computing Center in Autumn 2017.
