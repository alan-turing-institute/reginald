To address the climate and biodiversity crisis and the need for greater sustainability.
High-impact environmental events such as heatwaves, flooding and droughts are increasing in both frequency and magnitude. This threatens our planet, including the four billion people who live in cities and the rich biodiverse natural ecosystems from which life on earth relies on. Never has our planet experienced such rapid increase in the extraction and use of natural resources, including fossil fuels and critical minerals now used by industry. The path we are on is unsustainable and evidence indicates that we could be heading towards a sixth mass extinction. We understand the causes: they include climate change, land use and pollution. It is not too late to turn this around.  
To act on this we need to slow the pace of global heating, predict and mitigate climate impacts, and provide clear evidence to develop national and international policy to meet net zero targets.  
Environmental and sustainability datasets come in all shapes and sizes from past climate signals and fossils buried in rocks and ice; monitoring our planet and infrastructure using in-situ and remote sensors including imagery from cameras and satellites; and the output from highly detailed and complex state-of-the-art process-based computer model simulations. 
To understand and predict future change we need to harness knowledge to best effect, to maximise the usefulness of our existing observations and sensor networks and provide intelligence for future sensor placement. 
We must also leverage solutions and ideas seamlessly from across disciplines, bridge and integrate data across spatial and time scales, and deploy solutions in a timely manner to help secure our planet for future generations. 
We believe that truly interdisciplinary research will catalyse the next big step-changes in environment and sustainability innovation. To deliver the change we need will require diverse teams and skills to co-design and co-develop solutions. 
Our expertise in applying data science and AI across a broad range of science and engineering makes the Turing uniquely placed to play a central role in tackling and averting the climate and biodiversity crisis in order to help society and life prosper in a net zero world. No single institute is as well-equipped as us to drive forward the development of robust open-source and community-led AI algorithms, data science and digital pipelines to democratise the use of these tools to safeguard our planet.   
We need to break-down silos and foster strong and lasting collaborations to create adaptable tools and develop state-of-the-art digital methods for automated knowledge-informed and data-driven environmental monitoring and forecasting.  
Our expertise in digital twinning enables us to advance efforts to optimise the infrastructure in which our society relies on, and model interventions to support pathways to decarbonisation, sustainable use of natural resources, and provide trustworthy evidence for policy making. 
‘Climate change and biodiversity loss are defining challenges of our time. And the new strategy of the Alan Turing Institute rightly identifies as a grand challenge in environment and sustainability. By harnessing the UK’s world leading expertise in data science alongside other centres of excellence in the UK, such as the Met Office, the Alan Turing Institute will play a key role in addressing environment and sustainability.’ 
Professor Stephen Belcher, Chief of Science and Technology, Met Office  
‘Scientific collaboration and the sharing and unlocking of data is critical if we are to find solutions to climate instability and biodiversity loss. Working with organisations like The Alan Turing Institute will be key to driving solutions to the planetary emergency, with positive environmental outcomes towards sustainability, as reflected in their future strategy.’ 
Dr Tim Littlewood, Executive Director of Science, Natural History Museum 
The Institute is developing a set of missions to sit under the Environment and Sustainability Grand Challenge, to be launched soon. 
We need collaborators to help us to solve this Grand Challenge. Sign up to our newsletter to stay in touch with the latest news.
