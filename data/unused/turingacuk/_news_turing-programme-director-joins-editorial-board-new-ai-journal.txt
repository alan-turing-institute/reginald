Professor Chris Holmes has joined the editorial board of a new AI journal, launched this month by the publisher of the New England Journal of Medicine, NEJM Group. 
 
The journal, NEJM AI, aims to identify and evaluate state-of-the-art applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to clinical medicine. 
 
The journal will publish original research and provide reviews, policy perspectives, and accessible educational material targeted at practicing doctors and clinician leaders interested in applying AI, computer scientists seeking to translate algorithmic advances to clinical practice, and policy makers and regulators. 
 
It will pair pre-clinical and clinical articles to offer important context to both clinicians and non-clinician researchers and will connect the fast-moving developments in AI, informatics and technology in medicine with the application of these advancements to clinical practice.  
 
Professor Holmes joins the editorial board of the new journal bringing with him a wealth of experience in theory, methods and applications of robust statistical machine learning and causal inference to addressing real-world problems in health.  
 
Professor Holmes, Programme Director for Health and Medical Sciences at The Alan Turing Institute, said: “I’m delighted to be a part of this new and important journal. Artificial intelligence has the power to transform medicine and medical research, but careful evaluation of the robustness of empirical results and awareness of issues of fairness are vital. I’m really excited to see how NEJM AI will become a showcase for best practice across different disciplines in AI research for medical science.” 
 
The Health and Medical Sciences Programme aims to accelerate the scientific understanding of human disease and improve human health through data-driven innovation in AI and statistical science. They have provided COVID-19 expertise to the UK government and developed the first international guidelines for clinical trials involving AI.
