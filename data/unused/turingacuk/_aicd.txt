Advances in intelligent autonomous agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have demonstrated super-human capabilities across a range of simulated and game-based tasks. Recent ground-breaking performances include enhancing the speed of fundamental mathematical operations, and defeating the world champion of the popular multiplayer real-time strategy game Dota 2.
These breakthroughs have been made possible by new developments in DRL, allowing intelligent agents (IAs) to identify winning strategies despite imperfect information, highly complex action and observation spaces, and immense game trees. Until now, the computer security and privacy research communities have been largely focussed on conventional (un)supervised machine learning. While this type of AI is great at classification, for example identifying malicious computer binaries or anomalous network traffic, it does not natively support learning from interaction. DRL and related techniques offer a mechanism for planning strategically that we intend to show, through this project, can transform our understanding of, and capacity to attack and defend, computer systems and networks.
The centre is led by principal investigators Vasilios Mavroudis and Chris Hicks who are computer security researchers seeking to fundamentally transform the way in which we secure digital systems through the development and application of cutting edge, deep-learning based approaches to intelligent agents. Our current focus areas are as follows:
Autonomous cyber operations and network defence
AI for Systems Security
Adaptive fuzzing and state-machine learning
Cryptographic ciphers, protocols and their implementations
Although dedicated to solving security and privacy problems rather than any one method (i.e., DRL) for doing so, we are currently researching the following DRL techniques:
