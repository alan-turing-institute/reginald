An event series for Turing-Roche partnership updates, knowledge sharing and new perspectives. Find out more about the series.
 
This month, rather than tackling a data science theme, we will be doing a review of the partnership so far and a look forward to our plans in 2023.
We'll be hearing from our partnership team, including leads Chris Harbron, Expert Statistical Scientist and Advanced Analytics Lead, Roche and Ben MacArthur, Deputy Programme Director for Health and Medical Sciences at the Turing.
The team will give a review of our first year and updates on our current research themes of structured missingness and predictive modelling. We will also hear from our Senior Postdoctoral Research Associates and activities from the community side. Finally the team will look forward to 2023 and discuss some of our plans/new year's resolutions.
