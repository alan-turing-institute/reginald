Albese Demjaha was a former PhD student at UCL supervised by David Pym and Simon Parkin. Her research interests are in information security management,  human-centred security, and behavioural economics. She specialises in the human aspects of information security and focuses on cultural and behavioural aspects of security in her work.

During her doctoral experience, she was a teaching assistant for the module “People and Security”, both at UCL and University of Oxford. In addition, she was first the teaching assistant for the module "Information Security Management" at UCL and later became the lecturer for that module.

She did her MSc in Information Security at UCL where her thesis explored the possibility for new metaphors for end-to-end encryption. Albesa also has a BSc in Information Systems and Management from the South East European University in Skopje.

 
Albesa's PhD work is in the field of human-centred information security in an organisational context. More specifically, it focuses on the cultural and behavioural aspects of security and it is about properly and rigorously defining what a security culture is in such a context. Within this field, a parallel interest is to create a robust and repeatable methodology for co-design and modelling of security. Albesa is also keen to link her work to security policy.
