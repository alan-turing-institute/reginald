This event will be on the theme of AI and Health Equity- exploring how we ensure emerging technologies improve healthcare for all and don't exacerbate existing inequalities in the system. 
 
We will be hearing from Honghan Wu, a Turing Fellow and Associate Professor at the Institute of Health Informatics, UCL; Fanny Sie, Head of AI and Emerging Technology External Collaborations and Joshua Hoang, AI and Digital Healthcare Partner both at Roche.
Honghan's talk will be on 'Fair’ in the context of AI enabled clinical decision making': we know bias exists in health data and AI in medicine might channel and exacerbate health inequality without effective mitigations. However, what is fair exactly in the context of health equity? There seems no consensus yet. In this talk Honghan will stimulate a discussion on this point. In particular, he will give one definition, present a quantification framework based on it and show the results of a set of experiments on several decision making scenarios on two real-world intensive care unit datasets.
Fanny and Joshua's talk 'AI with Roche Contributing to Health Equity through Open Science': AI with Roche (AIR) is a Canadian-based centre of excellence aimed at delivering better health outcomes to people through the discovery and application of AI research. Underpinned by an open and collaborative exchange uniquely supported by Roche expertise, AIR is developing and promoting the integration of AI for health care by fostering partnerships within Canada and beyond. AIR's collaborators include the Pan-Canadian AI institutes (Amii, MILA and the Vector Institute) as well as multidisciplinary innovators from across the health ecosystem (startups, multinationals, patient advocacy groups, clinicians). By creating mission and mandate-driven engagements, AIR democratizes access to data, tools and expertise in the pursuit of accelerating scientific discovery and health equity within a sustainable model for society. Experiences Fanny will share in this talk include the Roche Data Science Coalition and EndALS open science challenges which can be found on the AIR website.
