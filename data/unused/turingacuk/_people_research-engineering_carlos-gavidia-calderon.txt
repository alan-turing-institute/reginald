Carlos Gavidia-Calderon is a researcher, software developer, and educator. He is currently a Research Software Engineer at The Alan Turing Institute.
He graduated in 2020 from University College London with a PhD in Software Engineering, under the supervision of Earl T. Barr, Federica Sarro and Mark Harman. As a postgraduate researcher, Carlos studied cooperation in software development teams using game-theoretic models. He also has a Masters in Computer Science from Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; with a dissertation on ant colony optimisation algorithms applied to computer vision. Previously, Carlos was an undergraduate student of Systems Engineering at Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria.
As a software engineer, Carlos worked on projects ranging from mobile applications to large-scale information systems. His industry roles included senior software engineer and technical lead. He has also taught courses on programming fundamentals and algorithms to undergraduate engineering students.
At the Alan Turing Institute, Carlos is developing privacy-aware tools for generating synthetic data. He is also actively involved in activities for widening the participation of students from diverse backgrounds in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
