Mateo Neira is a PhD student at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at UCL, under the supervision of Dr Elsa Arcaute and Prof Stephen Marshall. Mateo is interested in the application of data science and artificial intelligence on the built environment. He is an architect with a MSc in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics from UCL, and works at the architectural practice Foster + Partners where he implements novel frameworks and methods to understand cities and urbanisation to inform design strategies. His interests revolve around cities as systems of interaction, particularly how urban dynamics shape and are shaped by collective behaviour.
Mateo is interested in modelling, understanding, and predicting innovation, economic growth, and social sustainability in urban systems. His research seeks to deepen the quantitative understanding of human behaviour within cities and the coupling and interactions between social, economic, and spatial systems. Particularly, he aims to understand the impact of infrastructural networks on different urban process and dynamics at inter and intra urban systems through a multiplex network framework and stochastic models.
