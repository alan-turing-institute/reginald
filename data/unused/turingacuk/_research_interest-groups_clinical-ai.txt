The Clinical AI interest group seeks to bring together health professionals from diverse healthcare fields and data scientists who have a shared interest in clinical AI and to foster this network through interactive events on up-to-date developments in the field and cultivate innovative research projects.
The clinical application of medical artificial intelligence is an area of mass interest to researchers, governments and industry and has the potential to improve clinical care. However, if this potential is to be realised, a substantial effort is required to up-skill the clinical workforce and to educate future generations of healthcare professionals in the development, application and pitfalls of clinical AI.
The Clinical AI interest group will address the following aims:
Challenge: In recent times there has been an explosion in the development of AI algorithms for use in clinical practice. These may be undoubtably useful, but still require robust assessment and evaluation.
Challenge: With rapid developments in AI and the growth of their adoption in the clinical realm it is crucial to identify the future direction of travel and new areas of usage.
Challenge: AI systems can learn and perpetuate existing biases within the health system and widen health inequalities. As more AI systems are developed and adopted, strategies need to be in place to ensure it benefits all patients and public, including those in minoritised and marginalised groups.
