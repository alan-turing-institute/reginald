Prior to joining the Research Engineering Team, Ryan completed his PhD at the Turing (with the University of Warwick) where he focused on developing Monte Carlo methods for statistical inference. 
Ryan graduated from the University of Leeds in 2018 with an MMath Mathematics degree, where he took a particular interest in statistical theory and methodology. He commenced his doctoral studies at the Institute in September 2018, under the supervision of Murray Pollock, Gareth Roberts and Petros Dellaportas. His areas of interest include computational statistics, Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian theory.
Ryan was awarded the Royal Statistical Society Prize in 2018 for his performance in his MMath Mathematics degree at the University of Leeds.
