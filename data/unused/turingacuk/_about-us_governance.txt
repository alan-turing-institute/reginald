The charitable object of the Institute is the furtherance of education for the public benefit particularly through research, knowledge exchange and public engagement in the fields of data sciences. In 2017, as a result of a government recommendation, we added artificial intelligence to our remit.
The Institute is governed by its Board of Trustees who are also its Directors. The Board of Trustees is made up of independent members and nominated Trustees from each of our joint venture partners.
The Institute’s founding partners are the Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, University College London and Warwick and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.
Answering a national need for investment in data science research, they formed the Institute as a joint venture in 2015, following an open competition run by the EPSRC.
Each founding university has appointed a Turing University Lead who acts as an interface between the Institute and the founder university.
The Institute is governed by its Board of Trustees who are also its directors. The Board of Trustees is made up of independent members and nominated trustees from each of our joint venture partners. Douglas Gurr has been appointed as the new Chair of the Board of Trustees.
The Institute Director and Chief Executive is Professor Sir Adrian Smith. Research at the Institute is delivered and supported by the Chief Scientist, CCO, COO, and Programme Directors.
The Institute’s Research and Innovation Advisory Committee brings together the Institute Director, the Turing University Leads and the Institute’s Programme Directors to advise the Institute on its research and academic agenda. It is chaired by Professor Katharine Robson Brown.
The committee consists of the following four working groups:

The Institute will soon be opening an international call for new members of the Scientific Advisory Board, and will send out further communications in due course.
A team of Programme Directors oversee research programmes undertaken at the Institute with our strategic partners.
Representatives from the strategic partners are regularly convened in a Strategic Partners Board. The role of this Board is to advise the Board of Trustees on the content and translation of the research generated by the Turing, and work with the Institute and across the strategic partners to identify new opportunities for collaborative research and translation opportunities.
The Alan Turing Institute has an honorary fellowship scheme designed to recognise individuals who have substantially supported the Institute and its goals.
Anyone involved in the Turing community can nominate an Honorary Fellow. The Board of Trustees will review nominations, and expects to appoint a small number of Honorary Fellows each year.
Read our criteria for honorary fellowships and download the form to nominate an Honorary Fellow.
The long-term interests of the Institute’s University Partners are represented by the University Partners Board, which advises the Institute on strategy in the context of the UK higher education landscape:
