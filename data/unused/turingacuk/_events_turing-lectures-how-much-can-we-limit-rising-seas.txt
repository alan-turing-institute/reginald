Dr Tamsin Edwards is a climate scientist and award-winning communicator, specialising in quantifying the uncertainties of climate model predictions, particularly for the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet contributions to sea-level rise. Tamsin is an IPCC author and co-presenter of the 39 Ways series.
This event is organised in collaboration with the Royal Institution of Great Britain.
Eighty-four scientists in fifteen countries. Twenty-one regions of the world with glaciers or ice sheets. Thousands of computer simulations. How was all this put together, amid a global pandemic, to predict sea level rise for the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?
In this Turing Lecture, climate scientist Tamsin Edwards will discuss leading an international team of scientists and using machine learning techniques in the most comprehensive effort yet to predict 21st century sea level rise.
In the midst of COP27, Tamsin will also provide an update on the emissions pledges made to meet the Paris Agreement (2015), and conduct a live experiment to demonstrate how much global warming we should expect based on our current behaviour, and what actually causes sea level rise (hint: it’s probably not what you think!).
Through thought-provoking discussion and creative demos, expect to come away with a new appreciation of the technology that’s helping us to understand sea level rise.
