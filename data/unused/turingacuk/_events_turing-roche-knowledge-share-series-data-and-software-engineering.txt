An event series for Turing-Roche partnership updates, knowledge sharing and new perspectives. Find out more about the series.
 
This event will be on the theme of data and software engineering. This domain is becoming increasingly critical in all research where there is a need for high-quality tools, practices, methodologies, platforms and systems.
We'll be hearing from Daniel Sabanes Bove, Senior Principal Data Scientist and Associate Director, Statistical Engineering at Roche and Martin O' Reilly, Director of Research Engineering at The Alan Turing Institute. Both will discuss how software engineering teams are set up and operate respectively at Roche and the Turing, how they are working in a collaborative manner and examples of their work in the health sphere.
The event will conclude with a Q&A, we also hope to continue discussions pre and post the event via our Turing-Roche Slack Workspace which you can join.
