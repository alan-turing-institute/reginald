Prof. Gesine Reinert is a Research Professor at the Department of Statistics, Oxford, and Fellow at Keble College, Oxford (2000 – present).  
Her current and main research interests are in network statistics and to investigate such networks in a statistically rigorous fashion. Often this will require some approximation, and approximations in statistics are another of her research interests. Stein’s method is an excellent method to derive distances between the distributions of random quantities, and is one that Prof Reinert has required some expertise in over the years. Moreover she uses theoretical insights to develop machine learning methods for the analysis of network data, to tackle problems in finance, economics, and computational biology.
