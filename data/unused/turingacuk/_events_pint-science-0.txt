Pint of Science is a worldwide science festival which brings researchers to your local pub to share their scientific discoveries with you - no prior knowledge required. Tickets cost £5; all proceeds go towards sustaining the events.
This is an in-person event. Doors open at 18:30, talks start at 19:00
From social media algorithms to autonomous vehicles, the possibilities of AI seem endless. It can do incredible things, but there are potential harms and drawbacks too. How can we harness its power for the betterment of society, and who can we trust to ensure that our data is being handled responsibly?
Join researchers from The Alan Turing Institute as we delve into some of the ways we are using AI and data science for good. We'll be exploring topics such as AI for the natural world, and the trade-off between privacy and accuracy when it comes to finding love online. 
Can AI save the planet? - Evangeline Corcoran 
The climate crisis is already having profound effects on our everyday lives. From longer droughts to more severe storms, the future of our planet is uncertain. Finding solutions requires reliable and effective methods for measuring and predicting how animals, plants, and ecosystems will respond to future conditions.
AI may provide hope, with the promise of more accurate and rapid methods to monitor and predict environmental responses to possible futures.
But the question is, how best to apply these methods to make sense of our ever-changing, unpredictable natural world?
Swipe right for privacy-preserving, fair, and robust machine learning models - Aras Selvi
The last five years have seen a massive shift in the way we view and understand our rights when it comes to data privacy. With countless social media giants hitting the headlines for questionable practices over the uses and misuses of our personal data, we’ve had to wise up, and quickly. Enter dating apps, and the promise of love with the perfect match throws all our good sense out the window, making us vulnerable to bad actors.
Is it too much to expect private, fair and robust algorithms in the world of online dating? We say no!
The Big Fat Quiz of AI - Kristina Ulicna, Martin O'Reilly, Samuel Tonks, hosted by Hari Sood
Are headlines about AI spamming your newsfeed? Can you tell the difference between a human and a bot? Well, buckle up for a quiz on all things AI(ish), guided by a panel of experts.
