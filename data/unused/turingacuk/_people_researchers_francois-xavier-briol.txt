Dr. François-Xavier Briol is a lecturer in statistical science at University College London and a group leader in data-centric engineering at The Alan Turing Institute. He leads a project on the fundamentals of statistical machine learning, which develops novel methodology to enable the use of large-scale engineering models. For more details, you may instead want to have a look at his personal website.
Dr. François-Xavier Briol is interested in developing novel methodology and theory at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics. Through The Alan Turing Institute, he is collaborating on a number of research projects which are focused on statistical machine learning methodology specifically designed to tackle problems in the field of telecommunications and climate modelling.
