Iain Stenson is a Research Software Engineer at The Alan Turing Institute. He did a degree in Physics before moving into industry, first working on network performance measurements and then crystal structure visualisation. He moved into academia to work at the Cancer Screening and Prevention Research Group at Imperial College London, followed by a research software engineering role in QMUL’s HPC team and then the Turing’s Research Engineering Group (REG).
Iain has a strong interest in programming languages and in development tools and practices.  As part of the REG, he splits his time between Research Computing tasks (supporting and improving the Turing’s research computing infrastructure) and other data science & AI projects.
