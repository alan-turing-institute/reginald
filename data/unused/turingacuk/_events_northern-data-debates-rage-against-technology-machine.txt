Spirited conversations that bring world-leading experts together from a variety of backgrounds to discuss issues of critical interest where data science, artificial intelligence and the real world collide. Sponsored by The Alan Turing Institute, the National Innovation Centre for Data (NICD) and Newcastle Data.
From Amazon to Facebook and from algorithms to locational surveillance, technological advances over the past decade have profoundly changed society. Many of these changes have been positive, including connecting people in new ways, expanding new forms of entrepreneurship, helping government and cities run more efficiently, and improving health and medical care. Other impacts have proven more worrisome, however, especially where individual privacy and technological bias are concerned.
Our second Northern Data Debate brings together experts in technology, digital change, and society from a variety of perspectives to discuss why we’re so frustrated with the technology machine, how we can ensure technology is a force for good for people and society, and how we best tackle the challenges that new technologies throw our way.
