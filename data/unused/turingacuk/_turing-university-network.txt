The Turing University Network provides all UK universities with an interest in data science and AI the opportunity to engage and collaborate both with the Institute and its broader networks.
The network is a key component of the Institute Strategy aimed at changing the world for the better with data science and AI. The network supports the Institute in achieving its three ambitious goals: advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges, build skills for the future, and drive an informed public conversation. It enables the Institute’s role as a national convenor in the data science and AI landscape and creates opportunity for meaningful collaboration where interests align across research and innovation, skills and engagement.
The network is open, with minimal barriers to both entry and bureaucracy, and provides enablers such as mechanisms to connect across the ecosystem, interesting problems and routes to impact. Through Turing-coordinated activity, the network provides a structure for UK universities to facilitate better connections and collaboration with one another and showcase their data science/AI activity. It also provides universities with an opportunity to engage with various Turing departments and teams.
36 universities from the previous Turing university partners and Turing Network Development Award recipients have joined the pilot network and a call inviting applications from all UK universities is now live.
Members of the Turing University Network nominate a Turing liaison as the primary contact person at the university. Further information and contact details are available here.

 
We are pleased to announce that the Institute is currently inviting applications from universities across the UK to join the Turing University Network. Applications are being accepted via an open call, all UK universities with an interest in data science and AI are invited to apply. Full details are available on the Turing University Network Call 2023 page.
Universities interested in joining the network are invited to contact the Academic Engagement team for an introductory discussion.
To showcase the breadth of activity taking place across the UK's AI and data science landscape, please see our list of events hosted by universities from around the Turing University Network.
Institute schemes and initiatives are not limited to those in the Turing University Network and researchers at universities outside the network are encouraged to consider all available opportunities:
