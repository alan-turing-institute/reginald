Professor Aldo Faisal is the Professor of AI & Neuroscience at the Dept. of Computing and the Dept. of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. In 2021 he was awarded a prestigious 5-year UKRI Turing AI Fellowship.
In 2019, Aldo became the founding director of the £20Mio UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare and leads the Behaviour Analytics Lab at the Data Science Institute, London. Aldo works at the interface of Machine Learning, Neuroscience and translational Biomedical Engineering to help people in diseases and health.
He currently is one of the few engineers worldwide that lead their own clinical trials to validate their technology. In this space, his works focus on Digital Biomarkers and AI for medical intervention (Makin et al, Nat Biomed Eng; Komorowski et al, NatMed, 2018; Gottessmann et al NatMed, 2019). His work has received several prizes and awards, including the $50,000 Research Discovery Prize by the Toyota Foundation.
