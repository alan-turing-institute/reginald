Date: Wednesday 29 March 2023Time and location: 14:00 - 15:00, OnlineOrganised by: Edinburgh Futures Institute, The University of Edinburgh
Our love of fashion is driving an unsustainable system of manufacturing, distributing and disposing of our clothing that is impacting our planet. How can we change our behaviour and the system for the love of the planet? What does the data tell us, how can we harness new technology such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics and informatics, and creative tools such as Augmented and Virtual Reality. What is the role of 3D environments, games and NFTs in fashion? Register now.
Love Machine is a programme of events, created in collaboration with partners across the Edinburgh Futures Institute. The season explores the interconnections of AI and data with humanity through conversations, performances, and workshops. Explore the programme.

Date: Friday 31 March 2023Time and location: 14:00 - 17:00, HybridOrganised by: The Alan Turing Institute
We welcome you to join our first hybrid event to meet, connect and formally launch the Supra-Clinical AI Groups. These groups are focused on specialist interests in the particular clinical fields of Medical imaging and Computer Vision, Neurology and Mental Health and Anaesthetics and Intensive Care.
You will hear from the leads of the Supra-interest groups, about our plans for the Clinical AI Summer School as well as it being a welcome opportunity to meet the wider community.
Our keynote will be given by Alastair Denniston, Consultant Ophthalmologist (Uveitis and Medical Retina), University Hospitals Birmingham NHSFT & Honorary Professor, University of Birmingham, UK.
His talk will be about 'Ensuring AI in health is safe, effective and equitable’.
Register now.

Date: Friday 31 March 2023Time and location: 10:00 – 15:00 GMT, Online via Microsoft TeamsOrganised by: School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton
This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners working on and with AI in the Defence and Mental Health sectors to share experience gained and lessons learnt between these disciplines. We will discuss the key challenges AI faces today and attempt to signpost the current directions of travel within AI research to overcome these challenges in the short and medium term. Register now.

Date: Monday 27 March 2023Time and location: 10:00 – 16:30 GMT, The Alan Turing Institute, British Library, 96 Euston Rd, London, NW1 2DBOrganised by: Safe and Ethical AI, The Alan Turing Institute
Over the past few years, the use of AI has continued to increase in healthcare services. Many healthcare providers are deploying AI-driven applications across various business lines, services, and products. Although AI can bring a range of benefits to healthcare providers and patients, AI can also raise novel risks for patients and even healthcare providers. The UK government is working hard to regulate AI in health to support the use of responsible and trustworthy AI. By doing so, we can unleash the full potential of AI while safeguarding our fundamental values and keeping us safe and secure. Register now

Date: Thursday 30 March 2023Time and location: 14:00 - 17:00, OnlineOrganised by: Queen's University Belfast
After years of rapid progress in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, ChatGPT has captured the public imagination in a way that is unprecedented for an AI system, reportedly acquiring over 100 million active users within two months of its launch. What are the scientific and societal implications of such models, and how will they impact the language sciences, language technology and society more generally? In this series of talks, experts in AI and the language sciences describe their recent research on the scientific and governance implications of large language models (LLMs). The event will also include a Q & A section, facilitating a more general discussion of the capabilities and impact of LLMs. Register now.

Date: Wednesday 29 March 2023Time and Location: 10:00 – 16:00 GMT, Teesside University, Campus Heart, Southfield Rd, Middlesbrough, TS1 3BXOrganised by: Teesside University
In this exciting one-day event, you will hear from leading researchers in the field of AI and cancer research, who will present the most recent applications of Data Science in healthcare.
