A Turing Data Story is an interactive mix of narrative, code, and visuals that derives insight from real world open data. They are written as pedagogic Jupyter notebooks that aim to spark curiosity and motivate more people to play with data.
Our project lives in Github in this repo.
The stories are published online and you can check them out here.
 
Our aim is to help people understand the data driven world around us. We want to inspire an open community around a central platform. One that encourages people to harness the potential of open data by creating 'data stories'.
These 'data stories' mix computer code, narrative, visuals and real world data to document an insightful result. They should be educational and relate to society in a way that people care about. They must maintain a high standard of openness and reproducibility and be approved by the community in a peer review process. The stories will develop data literacy and critical thinking in the general readership.
This project is ongoing and everyone is encouraged to help us build something that will be useful to many. There are several ways you can help:Story ideas: Have an idea for an interesting story that could be told if you had the data, or knew how to analyse it? We can help.
Data: Stumbled across an interesting dataset, or perhaps mashed together several sources of data yourself? We want to hear about it.
Code: Are you an expert in Bayesian analysis? Do you have good data visualisation skills? Put that knowledge to work!
Peer review: Know a bit about data analysis? Good at communicating that knowledge? Interested in learning about how it can be applied to understanding society? We need reviews to make sure our stories are the best they can be.
Communication: Are you an amazing writer? Help us tell better stories.
Community: Don't fit in any of the above categories, but still want to hang out and be involved? We've got you, drop us a line.
