The Alan Turing Institute’s research ranges from theoretical to applied. As the national institute of data science and AI, we are in a unique position to convene collaborations across UK industry, academia, and government.
The Institute is looking to complement and augment the UK’s capacity in data science and artificial intelligence through international collaboration. Our aim is to engage with international partners and their expertise to advance world class scientific and technological innovation and utilise data science and AI for social good in a way that is mutually beneficial for the UK and its collaborators. 
Our approach to international engagement is based on the principles of open-sourced research, research excellence and the co-design of collaborative projects with partners over contract or consultancy research. Organisations who are interested in engaging with the Turing and who share our principles and vision, should refer to our programme pages for information on our current research. 
For more information about the Institute and to discuss potential collaboration, please contact us via [email protected]. For delegation visits, we work in a busy environment but we try to accommodate requests when possible.
