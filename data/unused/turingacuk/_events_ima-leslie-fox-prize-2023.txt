Partnering with the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) in this year’s Leslie Fox Prize for the first time, The Alan Turing Institute is pleased to invite numerical analysts to attend the 21st Leslie Fox Prize presentation day. The exclusively in-person event takes place between 09:00 and 17:00 on Monday 26 June at the University of Strathclyde.
Featuring the next generation of worldwide leaders in numerical analysis, the presentation day will showcase a great range of important research topics, as well as current research developments in numerical analysis. The day-long event includes presentations from this year’s six shortlisted candidates, as well as outstanding networking opportunities with a brilliant selection of leaders and researchers in the field.
The Leslie Fox Prize presentation event takes place the day before the 29th Biennial Numerical Analysis Conference 2023, which is hosted by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Strathclyde from Tuesday 27 to Friday 30 June 2023. 
The event will not be live streamed but the recordings of the talks will be available on The Alan Turing Institute's YouTube channel afterwards. 
The biennial Leslie Fox Prize was first established in 1985, in honour of the eponymous researcher and distinguished mathematician, Leslie Fox (1918-1992).
Awarded every two years, the prize honours leading early career researchers in the field across the globe. Numerical analysts under the age of 31 submit papers for review with shortlisted candidates invited to give lectures at the Leslie Fox Prize meeting.
First and second places are awarded on the day by an expert adjudicating committee, based on mathematical and algorithmic brilliance in tandem with presentational skills.
The panel comprises sector-leading professionals, this year including:
Set to be an outstanding opportunity for numerical analysts to catch up with one another while expanding their networks and discovering the details of shortlisted candidates’ papers, mathematics doctoral candidates are invited to register attendance for this stimulating day of research and networking.
Lunch and refreshments will be provided. 
 
This event is organised in collaboration with the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA)

We welcome participation from all backgrounds, but this event will be of interest to numerical analysts.
