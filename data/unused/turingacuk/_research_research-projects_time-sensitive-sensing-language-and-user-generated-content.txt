Understanding how individuals' behaviour changes over time is very important, particularly in monitoring mental health conditions, which affect one in four people globally. This project will create AI models and natural language processing methods that are able to track the progress of an individual over time, based on their language use and other interactions through the use of digital media, called 'user-generated content' (UGC).  Major outcomes include software implementing time-sensitive sensors from heterogeneous UGC, and new tools for diagnosis and monitoring of mental health conditions, in keeping with good clinical practice. 
This project involves working with sensitive user-generated linguistic and heterogeneous content, the protection of which is a top priority of the work. The research protects the users first by anonymising all of their data that are used during the project and then by storing them in a secure environment that ensures their safety, non-transferability and allowing only certified access.
The major goal of this project is to develop personalised longitudinal sensors from individuals' language use and user-generated content (UGC) to better understand changes in behaviour over time, with applications in mental health. 
To achieve this goal, the project has the following objectives:
Finally, while the major focus of this work is around mental health, the aim is to develop models that can be incorporated in other domains leveraging UGC within the healthcare domain and beyond.
The project has a range of different stakeholders:
