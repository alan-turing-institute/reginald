Jonathan C. Roberts is a professor in the School of Computer Science, Bangor University, UK., He was a lecturer (Kent 1999), Senior Lecturer (Kent 2004, Bangor 2007) and became a professor in 2015. His research is focused on data visualization, visual analytics, human computer interaction and computing pedagogy. He is interested in how to analyse, visualise and interact with data, and how to sketch designs and make appropriate designs. He is the creator of the Five Design-Sheet methodology, and author of the book Five Design-Sheets: Creative Design and Sketching for Computing and Visualisation, Springer Nature, June 2017. He focuses on heritage and archaeology, oceanography, pedagogy, and social networking domains, Prof Roberts’ hypothesis is that by displaying the data in several different ways, and allowing the user to highly interact with it, then the user gains a better understanding of their data.
He is the School Director for Impact and Engagement and in July 2019 started a weekly Research Engagement meetups (trebling the quantity of School news articles) and lead on Project Rainbow (continuity of learning activities, see http://csee.bangor.ac.uk/). Leads the Visualization, Data-Modelling and Graphics research group (VDMG). Is a member of the UK CPHC (Council of Professors and Heads of Computing), a member of Senate, sits on the CoESE Ethics and Governance Committee (2018-) and on the Research Degrees Committee (2018-20).
