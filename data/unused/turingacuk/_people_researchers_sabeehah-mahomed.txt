Sabeehah Mahomed is a Research Assistant in Data Justice and Global Ethical Futures under the Ethic’s Theme of the Turing’s Public Policy programme. She currently works across projects on the ethical and responsible design of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. These include researching and analysing the context of children’s rights as they relate to AI through a series of engagements with schools across Scotland as well as projects with the UK’s Office for Artificial Intelligence and the Council for Europe.
Sabeehah holds a MSc in Digital Humanities (distinction) from the Department of Information Science/Studies at University College London (UCL). Her master’s thesis focused on public awareness and perception of racial bias in AI systems, which was presented at the 'Ei4Ai' (Ethical Innovation for Artificial Intelligence) Conference in July 2020, hosted by UCL and University of Toronto. Sabeehah also has a postgraduate Bachelor of Arts Honours Degree (Cum Laude) and a BA Degree (distinction) from the University of South Africa and University of Johannesburg. 
Sabeehah's main interests lie in the ethical governance and innovation of AI systems, data privacy & protection, and using technology for social good. She brings an interdisciplinary academic background with a keen focus on the humanities, human rights, and societal issues particularly for vulnerable, marginalised and minority groups.
Prior to joining the Turing, she conducted fieldwork research within the Somali migrant community in South Africa focusing on social dynamics as it relates to religion, integration, and international relations. This was later published by the Institute for Global Dialogue (IGD). Sabeehah also has experience in entrepreneurship, business, and education where she established a Mathematics education centre in South Africa, providing quality education to over 2000 students for 7 years and creating employment for over 40 individuals.
