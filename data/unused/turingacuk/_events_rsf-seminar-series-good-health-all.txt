A regular series of open invitation talks from leading voices in data science, AI, healthcare and those with lived experience dealing with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC). This seminar series is part of the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility project. 
Speaker: Dr Alisha Davies, Theme Lead for The Alan Turing Institute’s AI for Science and Government Health (ASG) programme
Event title: Good health for all - What do we need to know about health inequalities?
In England, someone born today in one of the most deprived areas has a life expectancy of 7-9 years shorter than someone born in the most affluent areas. These patterns are similar across other parts of the UK and globally.
Addressing health inequalities recognised as a key priority by the World Health Organisation and within the UN Sustainable Development Goals. “Reducing health inequalities is a matter of fairness and social justice” (Marmot, 2020).
In this session, Alisha will discuss factors that contribute to inequality across the health domain and will address existing challenges and the potential to achieve gains. There will be an opportunity to discuss how we can apply data science and AI to better address this challenge.
Whilst these tools are advancing early detection, prediction and management of multiple long-term conditions and models of personalised medicine, they are progressing slower with regards to health inequality. It is important to question why this is the case, and what opportunities exist in meeting this challenge.
