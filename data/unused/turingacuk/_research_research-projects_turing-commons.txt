Launched in 2020, the project sits under the public policy programme’s ethics and responsible innovation theme. The aim of the Turing Commons is to provide a range of resources for various stakeholders that are curious about the ethical and responsible use of data. The guidebooks and subsequent training offerings aim to host resources for everyone, whether you're a curious citizen looking to have greater control over local matters, or a data scientist looking to take more responsibility over the consequences of your research.

The four guidebooks below are updated and added to regularly, representing a living body of knowledge and resources.
Since 2020, we have developed reusable illustrations collaboratively with Jonny Lighthands. These have been shared for public use through our GitHub repository and can be reused under CC-BY 4.0 license with the appropriate citation:

The Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), Public Engagement of Data Science and AI (PED) and AI Ethics and Governance (AEG) guidebooks are designed for specific training courses that have been run previously or are currently in the process of being organised in collaboration with the Skills Team.
Typically, the training courses are held over the course of a week, are free, and open to any participants that meet the application criteria – this varies across course. For reference, please see the RRI and PED courses held remotely via Zoom in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Self-paced, online iterations of these training offerings will also be made publicly available via The Alan Turing Institute’s Online Learning Platform, starting in Autumn 2022.
Following a successful launch of the Responsible Research and Innovation training, the Turing are now working with partner organisations, such as the University of Edinburgh and their Biomedical AI Centre for Doctoral Training, to revise and tailor the structure, content, and delivery of the course to specific disciplines or domains. This will allow for open-source training material and guidance to be used in both self-directed learning and by external facilitators.
