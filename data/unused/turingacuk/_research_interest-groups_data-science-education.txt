A breadth of organisations, spanning academic, industry, learned societies and professional bodies contribute to addressing the skills challenges in data science and AI, and to identify good practices for education and skills provision. The data science education interest group brings these groups together to identify and address key challenges in research and innovation in data science and AI pedagogy and its implications for policy.
The principal activities of the Data Science Education group are the following:
The group will encourage members to:
Lack of alignment between training offerings and the needs of the workforce is a key inhibiting factor in both education and industry. Translation of academic innovation into industry is a key barrier to AI adoption; meanwhile, taught programmes rarely expose learners to the scale of problems faced in industry and research practice, nor provide the opportunity to develop business and sector awareness. This leads to challenges not only in supporting the translation of AI into practice, but the translation of leading industry practice back into the national training curriculum. How can we bring together industry and academic communities to share best practice around data science and AI education?
Diversity is essential to developing a robust data science skills base; therefore, we need to draw on the country’s entire intellectual capital. The inequitable impact of COVID-19 on women and BAME communities is likely to have slowed progress on diversity and inclusion in all sectors. When we consider the Office for National Statistics’ estimate that over 70% of 1.5 million roles at risk of automation are held by women, it is clear that urgent intervention is required. How can we democratise and widen access to training which is responsive and “at scale” and supports the creation of a culture and environment that retains talent, and a diverse workforce?
