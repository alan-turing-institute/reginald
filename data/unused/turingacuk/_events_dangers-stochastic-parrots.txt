Professor Emily M. Bender will present her recent (co-authored) paper On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?Â ðŸ¦œ
In this paper, Bender and her co-authors take stock of the recent trend towards ever larger language models (especially for English), which the field of natural language processing has been using to extend the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks. In the paper, they take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks?
The presentation will be followed by a panel discussion.
Time: 16:00-17:15Â BST / 8:00-9:15Â PDT
