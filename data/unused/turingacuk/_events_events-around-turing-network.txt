To showcase the breadth of activity taking place across the UK's AI and data science landscape, please find below a list of events hosted by universities from around the Turing University Network. If you have questions or would like to attend an event, please follow the relevant link and contact the university directly.
In most cases, these events are developed, managed and hosted by the individual universities. The Alan Turing Institute has no direct involvement in their organisation, or responsibility for their agendas, content or overall delivery. Where there is an exception, this will be noted on the individual event page.
We are pleased to announce that the Institute is currently inviting applications from universities across the UK to join the Turing University Network. Applications are being accepted via an open call, all UK universities with an interest in data science and AI are invited to apply. Full details are available on the Turing University Network Call 2023 page.
The Alan Turing Institute endeavours to keep health and safety at the forefront of all events. 
While it’s no longer a legal obligation, face coverings and hand sanitiser is available at our events. If you are displaying any COVID symptoms or have received a positive test, please do not attend the event. 
If you have any concerns regarding attendance at an event due to health and safety, please contact [email protected] and member of the team will get back to you.
