Omar Guerrero is the Head of Computational Social Science Research and leads the Policy Modelling Theme at the Turing's public policy programme. He is an economist by training, and has a PhD in Computational Social Science (CSS) from George Mason University. Previously, he worked at University College London and at the University of Oxford, in the Saïd Business School and in the Institute for New Economic Thinking.
Omar researches on different aspects of CSS, including methodology, large-scale data analysis, and different modelling flavours. He also enjoys translating this research into useful tools to help solving problems of public interest, leading him to work with various governments and international organisations around the world. At the moment, he is working on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality.
