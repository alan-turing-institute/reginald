The University of Birmingham’s Exchange Building, in the heart of Birmingham, is a place that brings together communities to shape the ideas and solutions that will make our cities and regions better places to live, work and learn - an ideal location for the Urban Analytics and Digital Twins Turing Regional Engagement event, taking place on 31st May 2023. 
 
This event will convene regional partners, including universities, city councils, businesses and other organisations interested in the opportunities presented by urban analytics. An example to be explored within the day includes digital twins, bringing the potential to provide cities with a bridge between the real and digital world, where smart buildings and infrastructure share information with a virtual environment providing potential decision-making tools for areas such as energy and transport. The day will:
Audience: This event is open to those in universities, city councils, businesses and other organisations, with an interest in urban analytics and their impact; no in-depth technical knowledge is required to attend.
