Giovanni is Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities at the University of Amsterdam and a Visiting Researcher at The Alan Turing Institute, where he was a Co-investigator on the Living with Machines project and convenes the AI for Arts special interest group.
He did his PhD at the Digital Humanities Laboratory of the EPFL in Lausanne, working on methods for text mining and citation analysis of scholarly publications, and is co-founder of Odoma, a start-up offering customised machine learning techniques in the cultural heritage domain.
Giovanni is primarily working on AI for cultural heritage and on the public understanding of science.
Prior to joining the Turing, Giovanni has been a researcher at Leiden University (CWTS), the Leibniz Institute of European History in Mainz, and the University of Oxford. He studied computer science (BSc) and history (BA, MA) in Udine, Milan, Padua and Venice in Italy.
