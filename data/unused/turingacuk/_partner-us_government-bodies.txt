In pursuit of our mission to make great leaps in data science and AI research in order to change the world for the better, we work alongside policy makers to improve public policy as well as the provision of public services using tools from data science and AI.
The ultimate aim of our work with government is to have a positive impact on the lives of as many people as possible. We are interested in collaborating with policy makers to develop innovative ways to provide government services: from allocating resources in the fairest and most transparent way, to designing personalised public services that are tailored to people’s individual needs and situations.
We are interested in exploring how we can use our expertise in data science, AI, and ethics to inform policy-making across all levels of government, from identifying policy priorities to evaluating policy outcomes.
We tailor our collaborations around the needs of our government partners – our partnerships range from small-scale research projects to multi-year research programmes. We encourage all policy makers with difficult-to-solve policy problems, unwieldy data sets, or an interest in data science and AI to email us at [email protected].
The Alan Turing Institute works with a wide number of organisations, including government, charities, companies and universities to undertake world-leading research to change the world for the better.
