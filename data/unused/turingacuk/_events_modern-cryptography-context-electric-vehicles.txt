Electric vehicles (EV) exist in a context that sees cars exchange data more than ever before. Vehicle software updates, communication with nearby devices, and even managing and unlocking vehicles remotely are all now becoming part of the daily reality of EV consumer ownership. But how are all of these communications secured?
This talk will introduce how modern cryptography is used to secure transport layer communications and especially how lightweight secure channel protocols can be applied in the context of Electric Vehicles. Namely, the following questions will be discussed (and more):
