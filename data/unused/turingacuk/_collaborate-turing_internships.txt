Launched in 2020, the Turing Internship Network is a national engagement scheme between our business partners and doctoral students across the UK and Ireland who are studying any topic with a data science and/or AI focus. The Turing's role is to facilitate and convene, pairing internship projects put forward by industry with talented doctoral students. The business partners host, supervise, and provide a salary for the successful interns.
Testimonial from one of our 2022 interns at Accenture.
 
Due to an increasing interest for students in acquiring industry experience and business awareness, and for the business sector to address emerging data challenges using state-of-the-art academic methodology, we are keen to ensure everyone benefits from the Institute’s unique position in convening businesses with academics. We are therefore extending our training leadership goal to support employment opportunities that tackle real-world challenges.
In this 6th round of recruitment, we are working with 6 TIN partners to offer new exciting internship opportunities where students can apply their knowledge and skills to different projects such as the detection of harmful memes online, reinforcement learning for the security of computer networks and systems and much more.
Please find below the descriptions of the roles that are open for applications:
 
 
 
Students must meet all the following eligibility criteria to be considered for the scheme: 
Additional eligibility requirements may apply for specific internships and those are specified in the role descriptions.
 
Applications for the Turing Internship Network are now closed. 
When applying, please read carefully the call document and these guidelines on how to write your application. If you are an international student studying in the UK on a visa, please read the Information for International Students document.   
 
We invite you to share with your supervisors information about the programme that can be found in this document.

In the first 5 recruitment rounds, we worked with 9 TIN partners and 9 TIN-DSG partners, and we successfully placed around 60 interns.
The internship roles advertised in the past cover a wide range of research areas such as data science and AI applied to finance, defence & security, environment and sustainability, the legal domain etc, and data science and AI in public policy.
Some examples of previously advertised roles are:

 
The Turing Internship Network provides a fantastic paid opportunity for students to apply their academic skills on real-world problems. In addition, a Turing internship provides students an excellent setting to expand their professional networks and to identify prospective employment opportunities following graduation.
Internships are provided and hosted by the TIN partner/collaborator who requires data-driven academic expertise for their business challenges.
Find out more about the TIN experience from Akhil Ahmed, intern at Accenture until April 2023.
 
"The Turing Internship Network provides an excellent opportunity to gain industrial exposure and to map academic research experiences to real-world challenges. I have a better understanding of the industrial challenges through this internship. It is a great experience to be able to solve real-world problems using my academic research skills."

TIN attracts high-quality interns to work on your data-driven business challenges. The Institute is well-placed in the UK national landscape to convene businesses and industry with high calibre academics.
The Institute will manage all processes and recruitment between you sending the role descriptions and up to interviewing the shortlisted candidates.
For more information about the scheme, please read the TIN brochure.
 
We are keen to work with a diverse portfolio of TIN partners and therefore we welcome all expressions of interest as long as the work the successful intern(s) would be doing involves some methods or concepts from mathematics, statistics, data science, computer science, AI, data ethics and/or technology.
If you would like to find out more about this scheme and would like to express interest on behalf of your organisation, we encourage you to complete the form below. A member of our Internship Network team alongside a Partnership Business Lead will contact you within five working days to discuss your interest and suitability for promoting internship roles through the TIN.
 

We hope that the Turing Internship Network will attract a diverse pool of both partners and applicants. All applications will be considered on their merits and project suitability. Applicants can be of any nationality (unless otherwise stated in the specific internship requirements) providing they have the right to work in the UK and applicants from under-represented groups are encouraged to apply. We welcome applicants from all UK-based universities, or who have taken a career break prior to their PhD. We welcome interested applicants to let us know what work arrangements would suit them best.
We are encouraging our existing and prospective business partners to consider developing inclusive internships (e.g. part-time and flexible working options, accommodating interns on a student visa, remote work, etc.) and this commitment is very important to the Turing when deciding who to work with through business partnerships.
The Alan Turing Institute is a Disability Confident organisation. As part of this commitment, we recognise that there may be individual circumstances that we need to be aware of. We aim to accommodate specific needs and personal circumstances, but we are reliant on applicants sharing this information with us. 
To discuss an adjustment to the application process please contact our team directly at [email protected]. There is also a section on the application form where applicants may make us aware of individual circumstances.
