To mark Earth Day, climate scientist Emily Shuckburgh joins us for our first virtual Turing Lecture on sustainability and the climate crisis. This event will be subtitled.

The last five years have seen the hottest temperatures ever on record and carbon dioxide has reached a level never before inhabited by humans. The conditions within which we are living today are unprecedented, and the effects are manifesting in extreme weather such as flooding and rising temperatures. Despite warnings from scientists and campaigners, world leaders have been slow to act, and we are now facing the biggest threat to our existence in the history of humanity. In this talk, climate scientist Emily Shuckburgh presents the facts and figures, based on world-class research conducted at Cambridge Zero, the University of Cambridge’s zero-carbon future initiative. She will discuss the scientific evidence around climate change, possible solutions being researched now to secure the future of our planet and the impact of COVID-19 on climate change.
This is an online event and will take place via Zoom webinar. You will have the opportunity to submit questions using the Q&A function once the event begins, or on Twitter using the hashtags: #TuringLecture #EarthDay and tagging @turinginst.
