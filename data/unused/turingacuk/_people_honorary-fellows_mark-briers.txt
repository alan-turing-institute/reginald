Mark Briers a Honorary Fellow of The Alan Turing Institute, and was formerly Programme Director for the defence and security programme. Prior to joining Turing, Mark worked in the defence and security sector for over 16 years, directing research programmes in the area of statistical data analysis, and leading large teams to drive impactful research outputs. He completed his PhD in 2007 at Cambridge University where he developed Sequential Monte Carlo based techniques for state-space filtering and smoothing. In recent months, Mark has been providing independent advice to scope the technical development and help to oversee modelling and analytics of the NHS Test and Trace app.
He is an Honorary Senior Lecturer at Imperial College London, where he teaches methodological techniques for use in a Big Data environment and conducts research into statistical methods for cyber security, and he is a Council Member at the Royal Statistical Society. He is an Industrial Fellow alumnus of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. Mark is a co-investigator on the EPSRC funded programme grant Computational Statistical Inference for Engineering and Security.
Mark's publications are listed on Google Scholar.
