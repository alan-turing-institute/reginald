The Advancing Data Justice Research and Practice project aims to broaden understanding of the social, historical, cultural, political, and economic forces that contribute to discrimination and inequity in contemporary ecologies of data collection, governance, and use. This is the consultation draft of a guide for developers and organisations, which are producing, procuring, or using data-intensive technologies. It provides actionable information for those who wish to implement the principles and priorities of data justice in their data practices and within their data innovation ecosystems.

This report was commissioned by the International Centre of Expertise in Montréal in collaboration with GPAI's Data Governance Working Group, and produced by the Alan Turing Institute. The research was supported, in part, by a grant from ESRC (ES/T007354/1), Towards Turing 2.0 under the EPSRC Grant EP/W037211/1, and from the public funds that make the Turing's Public Policy Programme possible.
