The finance and economics programme was founded in 2016. Initially the programme played a key role in fostering economic data science research, an emerging discipline at the intersection of economics and machine learning. Over the last five years the programme has grown exponentially and is today a nationally and internationally recognised research and innovation hub with the vision to enable a more resilient, secure, inclusive and productive economy through digital innovation.
Our work includes developing models to better understand economic networks through transaction data and economic nowcasting, developing privacy-enhancing technologies to improve data flow across government departments and working with regulators, and building monitoring systems for detecting market collusion and systemic risks.

The programme seeks to foster innovation and leverage our expertise through strategic, boundary-breaking collaborations with industry, academia, third sector and beyond.
We have a proven ability to set up and lead impactful national and international partnerships and collaborations, which range from project partnerships to multi-year, multi-party strategic partnership programmes. Key examples include our partnerships with HSBC, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Accenture and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  
We believe that by bringing industry and academia together we can combine our unique skill sets to tackle the challenges towards a more inclusive and productive digital economy.
The finance and economics programme has three main research challenges.
1. AI and data science for socio-economic systems
Improved resilience and economic security through:
 
 2. Safe and trusted AI systems for business and industry  
Improved productivity, and more inclusive, fair and robust services through:
 
 
3. Decentralisation and democratization of technology
Increased inclusion, efficiency, resilience, and security through:
