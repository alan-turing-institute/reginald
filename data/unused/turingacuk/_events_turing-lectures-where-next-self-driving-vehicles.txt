Sarah Sharples is Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department for Transport and Professor of Human Factors in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Nottingham. She has led research in transport, manufacturing and healthcare, and currently leads the EPSRC (Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council) Connected Everything Network Plus.
Hosted by Sethu Vijayakumar, Programme Co-Director for Artificial Intelligence (Robotics and autonomous systems) at The Alan Turing Institute, Professor of Robotics at the University of Edinburgh, UK and the Director of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics.
This event is organised in collaboration with the Royal Institution of Great Britain.
 
The Turing Lectures series brings together leading thinkers to inform, entertain, and shape the national conversation on data science and AI.
In this Turing Lecture, Professor Sarah Sharples (Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department for Transport) will discuss the interface between policy and science for self-driving vehicles, and highlight some of the challenges and opportunities that we face in this area.
Automation has been present within our transport system for years, but we are now entering an age of autonomy where the nature of transport is rapidly evolving. As we continue on our path towards self-driving vehicles, what is the role for science, and how do we take research into the world of policy and legislation at pace? How can we make sure that self-driving vehicles are good for individuals, for society, and for the economy?

 
Hands-on experience
This year, with the help of the Royal Institution, The Turing Lectures will include experiential demonstrations, bringing the lectures to life for in-person attendees.
With partners of The Department for Transport exhibiting various interactive demonstrations and activities, join us from 18:00 to experience virtual reality driving simulators designed to study user behaviour with future automated vehicles. Obtain first-hand experience of how automated vehicles will interact with pedestrians in urban settings. Feed into ongoing safety studies into pedestrians’ road-crossing behaviour in the presence of automated vehicles, and take a ride in a virtual, automated taxi.
The event promises a dynamic experience for all, and the opportunity to be a part of the driverless revolution.
The Royal Institution
The Royal Institution is an organisation dedicated to scientific education and research. Located in Piccadilly, it was founded in 1799 to "spread knowledge and facilitate general access to mechanical and useful inventions; to teach, through courses composed of philosophical conferences and experiments, the application of science to ordinary life."
Please note that registration for this event is managed by the Royal Institution and tickets to attend this event in-person start from £10. An access fund is available for anyone who would otherwise be unable to attend. Please contact [email protected] to enquire.
You can attend virtually free of charge, please click the 'register now' button to attend.
This series of Turing Lectures is organised in collaboration with The Royal Institution of Great Britain.
