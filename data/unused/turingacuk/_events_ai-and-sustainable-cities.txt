This is a scoping workshop activity centred on the theme of ‘Cities’ that examines the role of data science and artificial intelligence in paving the way for sustainable cities. Aspects of sustainability in cities include mobility, energy, and climate with central pillars of equality, security, and data privacy. Two-thirds of humanity are expected to live in cities in 2050. These are cultural and business centres but are also major consumers of natural resources and producers of emissions. To make cities more resource-efficient and environment friendly, these different aspects of sustainability need to be considered jointly instead of the currently silo-ed approach. The workshop is structured under four themes:
Each theme will feature a keynote speaker, two talks and 2 lightning talks; two themes will be covered each day of the workshop. Speakers will be invited from academia, industry, and governmental authorities to present diverse efforts that aim to instigate sustainability in UK cities. With a unique opportunity to convene diverse stakeholder visionaries of future cities from around the UK and across disciplines, the second day of the workshop will foster a panel discussion that is founded on central principles of sustainability
