The 20th TAROS conference will be hosted by the Centre for Advanced Robotics at Queen Mary University of London from 3 to 5 July 2019.
Find out more on the main conference website.
TAROS is the longest running UK-hosted international conference on Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS), which is aimed at the presentation and discussion of the latest results and methods in autonomous robotics research and applications.
TAROS offers a friendly environment for robotics researchers and industry to take stock and plan future progress. It welcomes senior researchers and research students alike, and specifically provides opportunities for research students and young research scientists to present their work to the scientific community.
 
Keynotes:
Machine Learning for Robots to Think Fast in the Face of Unexpected Events - Professor Aude Billard (Professor of Robotics, Swiss Institute of Technology Lausanne, EPFL)
An Overview of Research and Robotics at Google DeepMind - Dr Francesco Nori (Head of Robotics, Google DeepMind)
Robotic Dynamic Manipulation: Perception, Planning and Control - Professor Bruno Siciliano (Professor of Robotic Surgery, University of Naples Federico II)
Title TBA - Professor Véronique Perdereau (Professor of Robot Manipulation, Sorbonne University)
