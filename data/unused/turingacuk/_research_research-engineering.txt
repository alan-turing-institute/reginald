Researchers and practitioners face a common need for high quality tools, practices, methodologies, platforms and systems.
Many domains can benefit from the deployment of cutting-edge algorithms and approaches, but these cannot be effectively applied unless realised as usable software libraries, reproducible analyses and workflows, or high performance computational environments.
The Research Engineering Group (REG) contributes skills in research software engineering and data science in support of other programmes, as well as to its own projects. This model of working ensures that the tools they develop are useful and applicable to a wider range of areas. The team supports professional delivery of impactful research across the Turing's programmes, as well as its own research interests.
The team concentrate mainly on:
