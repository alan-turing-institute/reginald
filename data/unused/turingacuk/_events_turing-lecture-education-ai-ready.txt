Rose Luckin is Professor of Learner Centred Design at the UCL Knowledge Lab in London. Her research involves the design and evaluation of educational technology using theories from the learning sciences and techniques from artificial intelligence (AI).
She has a particular interest in using AI to open up the 'black box' of learning to show teachers and students the detail of their progress intellectually, emotionally and socially. Rose is also Director of EDUCATE, a London hub for educational technology startups, researchers and educators to work together on the development of evidence-informed educational technology.
Rose was named on the Seldon List 2017 as one of the 20 most influential people in Education. She is a UFI charity trustee, a governor and trustee of St Paul's school in London and a governor of the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton. She has taught in the state secondary, Further Education and Higher Education sectors, and she was previously Pro-Vice Chancellor for Teaching and Learning at the University of Sussex.
(Full bio in speaker profile)
COVID-19 has precipitated a major experiment for the UK’s education system that may change the way we teach and learn forever, but what role can and should AI play in this transformation? Professor Luckin will discuss the current stage of AI's application in education and the ways in which AI has supported teachers and learners during the pandemic.
Professor Luckin will also look towards the future and consider how AI could be used to support a COVID-compliant transformation for our education system - a transformation that seeks to enable all learners to achieve their full potential. Throughout the lecture examples from different AI systems will be presented to illustrate what is happening in the present and what could happen in the future.
We will also hear recommendations as to how our education system can become 'AI ready.'
