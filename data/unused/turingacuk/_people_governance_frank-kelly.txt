Frank Kelly is Professor of the Mathematics of Systems at the University of Cambridge and was awarded a CBE for services to mathematical sciences in 2013. His main research is in random processes, networks and optimisation, with a specialist focus on applications to the design and control of networks and to the understanding of self-regulation in large-scale systems. He has received several prizes for his work. These include the Royal Statistical Society’s Guy Medal in Silver, the John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, the David Crighton Medal of the London Mathematical Society and Institute of Mathematics and Applications, and the Alexander Graham Bell Medal of the IEEE. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Foreign Member of the National Academy of Engineering. He served as Chief Scientific Adviser to the Department for Transport (2003-2006), and as Master of Christ’s College, Cambridge (2006-2016).
