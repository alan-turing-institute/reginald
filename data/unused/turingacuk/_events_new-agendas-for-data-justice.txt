The Alan Turing Institute invites you to join us as we bring together 12 partners from across the world to share their research and to celebrate the many voices of data justice.
We will host two panel sessions featuring experts on the intersection of data and social justice from organisations spanning Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America. These panels will explore the 12 reports on data justice they have produced in close collaboration with impacted stakeholders as part of a research project undertaken in partnership with The Alan Turing Institute and The Global Partnership on AI.  This event will also feature the launch of episode 1 of a documentary-style series, Advancing Data Justice, and will mark the commencement of a consultation period where we invite public feedback on our data justice guides for policymakers, developers, and impacted communities.  
In 2021, the Global Partnership on AI chose The Alan Turing Institute to lead a project they had begun on data justice. With the help of additional funding from the UK government, the Global Partnership on AI and the Turing team were able to expand this project.
As a result, the scale of this research increased massively to incorporate the work of twelve Policy Pilot Partner organisations from Asia, Oceania, Africa, and South America.
Each of these organisations have been working to understand what data justice might look like in their distinct contexts. They have conducted extensive interview and workshop engagements with policymakers, developers, and impacted communities across the world.
This event presents the first opportunity for all 12 partners to come together with the Turing team to discuss their research findings with one another and to share them publicly.
In addition to these panel discussions, this event will feature the launch of Introducing Data Justice. This is the first of four films which track the work of our project partners in order to uncover how they understand data injustice, past and present, and how we might work towards improved data justice in the future.
Finally, this event will mark the start of a consultation period where we, at The Alan Turing Institute, begin to seek public feedback on three sets of data justice guidelines. Through this consultation, we hope to give communities around the world the opportunity to shape new agendas for data justice.
