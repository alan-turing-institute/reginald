The testing and evaluation of semi-autonomous systems in defence already produces significant challenges, from getting unmanned aerial systems in the air to seeking the right levels of assurance for decision-support mechanisms and human-machine teaming.
As technology moves towards fully autonomous systems, and then ones which incorporate AI and machine learning, how can the right levels of assurance be sought? How can fully-autonomous systems be safely allowed onto ranges for testing, be it land, sea or air? The nature of the pressures and responsibilities defence faces creates unique and often more pronounced challenges.
This workshop will bring together leaders from across government, industry and academia in order to understand and begin to tackle these challenges; challenges which will only grow over time as technologies evolve and become more complex.
By drawing on a diverse range of experiences the workshop will explore common challenges and approaches to future AI and autonomous T&E and V&V, bring together the key stakeholders within the community and start to solve these questions.
Registration from 10:00, workshop starts at 10:30
