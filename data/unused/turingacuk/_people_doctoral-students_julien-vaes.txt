Julien Vaes is a DPhil student at the University of Oxford. He has previously completed a master's degree in applied mathematics engineering at the Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium), as well as a master's degree in engineering at the Ecole Centrale de Paris (France).
Julien’s supervisor, Professor Raphael Hauser, investigated, with his former student Miha Troha, the problem of estimating the term structure of future prices in power markets on the basis of risk-averse optimal trading by producers and wholesalers, subject to the physical constraints of each power plant connected to the grid. In his DPhil project, Julien's objective is to further develop the structure problem established by Hauser-Troha by adding three important components that are currently missing: firstly, the market clearing auction as a last decision stage, secondly, the network capacity and regulatory constraints, and, thirdly, the renewable power sources into the energy mix considered.
