Adam Kucharski is an Associate Professor and Sir Henry Dale Fellow in the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Hi research focuses on analysis and modelling of epidemic-prone infectious disease. In particular, he is interested in how social behaviour and pre-existing immunity shape transmission dynamics, and how knowledge of such processes can improve surveillance and control measures.
He has previously worked on real-time modelling of infections including Ebola, dengue, and cholera, as well as leading ongoing research into influenza and COVID-19. 
From 2012-17 he held a Medical Research Council Career Development Award in Biostatistics, and prior to joining LSHTM he was a research associate at Imperial College London. He has an MMath in Mathematics from the University of Warwick and a PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.
