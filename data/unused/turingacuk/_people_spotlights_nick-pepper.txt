Before joining the Turing I completed a PhD in Aeronautical Engineering at Imperial College. My research focused on developing data-driven methods that quantify the effect of uncertainty on the performance of aerospace components. In the final year of my PhD I developed a method for assessing the probability of failure for safety critical systems as an intern at the NASA Langley Research Center. I have two Masters degrees: one in in Aeronautics from Imperial and the other in Physics from the University of Oxford.
I’m currently working as a Research Associate on Project Bluebird, a Prosperity Partnership between NATS, the UK’s largest air traffic provider, and the Turing. The aim of the project is to develop the world’s first AI system to safely control a section of airspace in live trials. Within the project, I’m a member of a team that is developing a Digital Twin that predicts the movement of aircraft through a sector of airspace.
The ambition of the project is exciting: Air Traffic Control is not the first application that people think of when discussing AI. In particular, aiming at full automation of a sector, rather than demonstrating methods in a simpler, idealised setting, is an interesting approach that allows us to identify the challenges facing AI in this domain.
I’ve really enjoyed collaborating with industry, it has provided opportunities to work with some really interesting and talented colleagues who have taught me a lot. A recent highlight was being invited by NATS to attend a short course at their college for Air Traffic Controllers. It was great to get an insight into the training that the controllers go through, without the pressure of knowing I’d have to do it in real life.
Getting outside as much as I can: most weeks I do a combination of cycling, tennis, and sailing. I love science fiction, which is normally my fallback if the weather’s bad: I have two cats with niche Sci Fi namesakes.
