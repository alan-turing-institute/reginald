This is a public discussion about finding the real people behind artificial intelligence.
#RealPeopleBehindAI
Artificial intelligence surrounds us, some automation we’re aware of: assembly line workers replaced by machines, or drones delivering packages ordered online. Other automation is more hidden: algorithms which decide who should serve prison sentences and for how long, or which CVs are sent in response to job recruitment adverts.
These differences in how we interact with our world are not new. From the plough to the PC, changes in technology have always been accompanied by changes in the nature of work. The growing use of artificial intelligence raises new questions across the sciences, arts and humanities, and for public policy.
This panel-led debate will focus on opening up and addressing questions about whose work underpins automation, whether this is work at all, and if so what kind? It will be a lively and multidisciplinary conversation, with as much audience participation as possible. Please bring your opinions and be ready to hear from others on what might we need to do to ensure diverse and fair contributions to automation which are appropriately recognised and rewarded.
This public event follows on from the one day workshop, where a group of researchers, practitioners and policy makers will discuss Automating the crowd. 
Event timings: 18:00 - 19:30, registration from 17:30The Alan Turing Institute is located on the first floor of the British Library and can be accessed via the main doors. Please allow 10 minutes for queuing when planning your journey.
