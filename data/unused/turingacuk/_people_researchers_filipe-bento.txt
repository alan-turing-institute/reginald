Filipe has a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies in Digital Platforms at the University of Aveiro / University of Porto, a Masters in Electronic Information Management from the University of Sheffield, and an Engineering degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from the University of Aveiro.
Before working at the British Library, he was an independent consultant in the areas of digital strategies and initiatives, library technologies, information management, digital policies, Software as a Service (SaaS) and Open Source Software (OSS). Previous to that, he worked at EBSCO Information Services in several roles, firstly as the Discovery Service Engineering and Support Team Manager (Europe and Latin America) and then for three years as the Software Services, Application Programming Interfaces (API) and Applications (Apps) manager. Filipe started his career as a lecturer and then as a computer specialist at the University of Aveiro’s Library, coordinating the development of its information systems for Library’s many branches for over fifteen years.
He is the former chairman of the board of the Portuguese Ex Libris Systems’ Users Association, and a previous member of the DigiMedia Research Center - Digital Media and Interaction at the University of Aveiro.
Filipe joined The Alan Turing Institute for the Living with Machines project in 2022.
 
Filipe is passionate about digital initiatives in libraries having a specific interest in Open Knowledge and Scholarly Communication and the dissemination of scientific information. He is an advocate of (Linked) Open Data and all the related innovative services that support them, not only within academia but also within industry and society in general.
