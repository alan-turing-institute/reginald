The Francis Crick Institute and The Alan Turing Institute have entered into a partnership to facilitate growth in data-centric biomedical science research collaborations. The partnership aims to bring leading data science and medical research closer together, and achieve transformational change in fundamental and applied research, talent development and public engagement.
In August 2020, the two organisations created a research collaboration framework agreement that is expected to drive further collaborative projects to the benefit of both partners.
For more information on the projects as a result of this partnership, please see the ‘Funded research’ links below.
A Joint Steering Committee has been stood up to govern this partnership and related project activity. Joint Steering Committee members include:
