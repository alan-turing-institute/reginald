Toxin diagnosis by cellular morphology
Diagnosing toxin exposure is not a trivial task, unlike viruses and bacteria that both contain DNA and can be cultured both of which can be used to identify their presence after exposure, toxins do not exhibit either of these properties.
The Data Study Group will focus on a proof of concept challenge, utilising data from a published manuscript. We would like to see if it is possible to utilise the morphology of the cell to identify if it has been exposed to toxin. Cell exposure data collected by imaging flow cytometry over a 48 hour time course can be used in this challenge, with ground truth populations available for both toxin exposed vs unexposed cells. This data is an excellent resource for a proof of concept tool to diagnose toxin exposure. Participants will be split into two groups: one focusing on the analysis of images and one focusing on characteristics that can be extracted from the dataset. Participants in both groups can utilise any methodology they see fit to complete this task. 
These are intensive 'collaborative hackathons' hosted at the Turing, which bring together organisations from industry, government and the third sector, with talented multi-disciplinary researchers from academia.
Organisations act as Data Study Group 'Challenge Owners', providing real-world problems and datasets to be tackled by small groups of highly talented, carefully selected researchers.
Researchers brainstorm and engineer data science solutions, presenting their work at the end of the week.
