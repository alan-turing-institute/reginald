In 2022, we funded seven innovative public engagement projects across the UK to boost understanding of AI and data science. People-powered AI, a project led by Dr Annabel Latham and Professor Keeley Crocket (Manchester Metropolitan University), received funding with the aim to build and encourage more diverse voices to interact with researchers and innovators during research and development (R&D) processes and wider public discourse. 
Following a series of successful engagements, leading to positive impact for several key stakeholders, we are pleased to share the terms of reference and case study booklet for anyone seeking to establish their own people's panel for AI. 
The terms of reference document was co-produced by panel members, businesses and researchers involved in the People’s Panel for AI project, led by Dr Annabel Latham and Professor Keeley Crockett
