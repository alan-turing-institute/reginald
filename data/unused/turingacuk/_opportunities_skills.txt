Our current work focuses on delivering immersive opportunities that upskill the professional community and support research. This enables a two-way talent flow exchange between academia and industry, whilst facilitating the creation and delivery of open, free, and accessible technical training.
The skills programme remit spans the following four areas of work (more information below): 
Please see our current open opportunities that you can register for or apply to: 
Our academic programmes provide opportunities for early career researchers to engage with and become part of the Turing community. We offer immersive opportunities aimed at learning new methodologies, allowing space to develop research independence and engaging with the Turing community to establish new collaborations:
Past academic programmes include:   
The Turing aims to help our community apply their research to real-world problems. Our applied skills programme provides opportunities for working with industry, government and third sector on real-world data science questions alongside their academic research:​
Other two-way talent flow schemes are being developed to support junior and mid-career researchers, to help them gain experience in an industry setting. Additionally, to support industry practitioners engage closer with academia through placements and secondments.  
As a national institute we are involved in driving impact, shaping policy and convening groups of experts that can help develop strategies for data science and artificial intelligence skills across the UK through the following initiatives:
The Turing aims to support the development and delivery of high-quality and openly accessible courses for our research community and beyond:
Based within the Academic Engagement Directorate, the Skills Team is overseen by the Turing Skills Group (TSG) to develop the Turing's skills strategy. The TSG is chaired by Iain Styles and composed of subject matter experts from the Turing, Turing Fellows and industry and public sector practitioners.  
The TSG is responsible for the development and quality of the activities that fall under the remit of the skills programme, including operational and strategic matters both at the Institute and at the national level.
