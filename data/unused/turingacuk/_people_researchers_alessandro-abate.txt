Alessandro Abate is Professor of Verification and Control in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. Previously he has done research at SRI International and at Stanford University, and has been an Assistant Professor at the Delft Center for Systems and Control, TU Delft. He has received a Laurea degree from the University of Padova and a MS/PhD at UC Berkeley. 
For more details, please see his departmental page or his research group page.
Alessandro's research interests lie in the analysis, verification, and optimal control of heterogeneous and complex dynamical models -- in particular of stochastic hybrid systems -- and in their applications in cyber-physical systems (particularly involving energy networks) and in the life sciences (systems biology). He is interested in a principled integration of model-based mathematical techniques with data-driven learning algorithms.
