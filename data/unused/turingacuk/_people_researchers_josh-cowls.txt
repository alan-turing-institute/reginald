Josh Cowls is the Research Associate in Data Ethics at The Alan Turing Institute and a member of the Institute’s public policy programme. A former Turing Doctoral Student, Josh pursued a DPhil at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, with a focus on the ethics and politics of algorithmic decision-making systems. His research agenda centres on democratic decision-making in the digital era, and he is the author or co-author of work on data ethics, state surveillance, online agenda-setting, and the use of web archives in publications such as New Media & Society, Minds and Machines, and in numerous edited volumes.
Josh is the Convenor of the Turing’s Ethics Advisory Group, a member of the Institute's Data Ethics Group, and sits on the Digital Catapult Machine Intelligence Garage’s Ethics Committee. As part of the public policy programme, Josh contributes to the Institute’s partnership with the Ada Lovelace Institute and its work with the Information Commissioner’s Office on a framework for algorithmic explainability.
