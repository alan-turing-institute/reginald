This event will be on the topic of personalised medicine in the face of multi-scale heterogeneity.
Complex pathologies often display heterogeneity at multiple scales. At the population level, different individuals have diverse exposures to disease modifying risk factors (e.g. cigarette smoking, body mass index, etc.), which drive inter-individual heterogeneity in pathological expression. While at the individual level, different tissues can have various degrees of disease involvement (e.g. due to local inflammation), contributing to intra-individual heterogeneity. Lastly, within disease-affected tissues different cells can exhibit a wide distribution of molecular hallmarks for disease involvement, resulting in intra-tissue heterogeneity. 
Understanding this multi-scale heterogeneity is essential to design and evaluate therapies in an increasingly personalised manner, with profound implications for drug discovery, biomarker identification and outcome assessment.
 
We will be hearing from our Turing-Roche Senior Postdoctoral Research Associate Christopher Banerji. Chris will use the example of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a complex rare-disease, as a prototype for muti-scale heterogeneity in pathology. He will show that integrating datasets at diverse scales, coupled with appropriate mathematical, clinical and cell biological analysis leads to important and novel insights into therapeutic development, biomarker discovery and lifestyle risk-factor identification.
