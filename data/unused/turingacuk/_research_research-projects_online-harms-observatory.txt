The Online Harms Observatory leverages our innovative research to help policy makers, regulators, security services and other stakeholders better understand the landscape of online harms. Initially, it will focus on online hate, extremism and misinformation. It aims to create a stepchange in how we understand the cross-cutting threats posed by this nexus of toxic content, with plans to expand to other harms in the near future. The Observatory was officially launched in March 2022 at AI UK, the UK’s national showcase of artificial intelligence.
This project is delivered in partnership with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport.
The first tracker in the Observatory focuses on the abuse faced by football players in the men’s Premier League. Ofcom commissioned an in-depth report off the back of this first set of dashboards. Key findings from the 2021/2022 season include:

Areas being explored for our next trackers include abuse directed at MPs, female journalists and women playing in the Premier League.
The Online Harms Observatory is supported by Wave 1 of The UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund under the EPSRC Grant EP/T001569/1 and EPSRC Grant EP/W006022/1, particularly the “Criminal Justice System” theme within those grants and The Alan Turing Institute. The Observatory is being delivered in partnership with the department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport.
