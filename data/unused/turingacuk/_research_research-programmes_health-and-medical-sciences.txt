AI and data science will improve the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of illness. They will optimise the provision of services, and support health service providers to anticipate demand and deliver improved patient care.
The Turing’s health programme is delivering a schedule of major research into the theory and methods of AI, statistics, and data analytics underpinning biomedical and health applications that are enabling scientists to do better science, without compromising respect for privacy and patient trust.
Using data-driven innovation in AI and statistical science, our aim is to accelerate the scientific understanding of human disease and improve human health.
We are now working on several large collaborations including with the pharmaceutical company Roche on missingness in data and predictive modelling, with Alzheimer's Research UK on early detection of neurogenerative diseases and with National Institute for Health and Care Research on the AI for multiple long-term conditions Research Support Facility. 
The Health programme is leading the development of one of Turing’s next Grand challenges - Transformation of healthcare - and we are actively seeking to establish new partnerships and programmes to underpin work in our four priority areas: Cell and Molecular Medicine, Disease prediction and early diagnosis, Clinical trials and clinical evidence evaluation, and Population Health.
To prepare for the next phase of research at the Turing, we are bringing together stakeholders from different sectors to scope the future of AI in health – a report from our recent activities in two priority areas – Cell and Molecular Medicine and Population Health can be found here: Scoping the landscape for the future of AI and machine learning in health .
The Turing-Roche strategic partnership was established in the summer of 2021 and is a five-year partnership focused on advanced analytics that is working to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes to improve clinical care. 
Our partnership will cover multiple activities to investigate how and why diseases affect people differently and why responses to treatment can vary. We will continue to build upon the connections and collaboration opportunities between The Alan Turing Institute, Roche, and the wider community.
We will be launching further research themes this year as well as building our community through activities such as our Slack Workspace, knowledge share series and newsletter.

The Research Support Facility (RSF), based at the Turing in conjunction with Swansea University and University of Edinburgh, offers AI and advanced data science support to the research teams funded by AIM and helps foster collaboration.
The facility, led by Dr Kirstie Whitaker and Professor Chris Holmes, works to embed best practices in data security and standards, reproducibility, and public and patient engagement across the research collaborations funded by the programme, ensuring effective knowledge sharing and reinforcing the Turing’s role as a national convenor and capacity builder in data science and artificial intelligence.

The Turing Health Programme is working with the UK’s leading dementia research charity Alzheimer’s Research UK on a global initiative to revolutionise the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The project will harness and analyse a wealth of digital data to develop signatures of disease – or “fingerprints” – that can be then detected using wearable technologies, such as smart watches.
EDoN is a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute, the National Physical Laboratory, and teams from University College London, Newcastle University, Exeter University, University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, working with funders and clinical delivery partners across the world.
