A regular series of open invitation talks from leading voices in data science, AI, healthcare and those with lived experience dealing with multiple long-term conditions (MLTC). This seminar series is part of the AI for multiple long-term conditions: Research Support Facility project. 
Speaker: Professor Bruce Guthrie, Professor of General Practice, University of Edinburgh
Event title: The challenge of defining multiple long-term conditions
Everyone is welcome but the target audience is clinicians, policymakers and health data science researchers. We hope that attendees will learn about the challenges of defining multiple long term conditions and strategies that can be applied to their respective areas of work.
Here’s a description of the session from Bruce:
‘Research examining multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) has been limited by wide variation in how MLTCs are chosen and defined. Studies are inconsistent in which conditions are included, how they are identified, and whether the measures are simple counts or were weighted in relation to a particular outcome.
In a systematic review of 566 studies examining multimorbidity - the clinical term for the measurement of MLTCs – the number of conditions included in measures varied from 2 to 285 (median 17, IQR 11-23), with an emphasis on cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory conditions. Mental health conditions in particular are not well represented in these studies. A quarter of studies included no mental health conditions, and no single mental health condition was included in more than half of studies.
In this talk, I will present the Delphi consensus study that seeks to harmonise definitions of multimorbidity and explore how sharing measurement strategies and methods will improve the comparability and reproducibility of research examining MLTCs.’
