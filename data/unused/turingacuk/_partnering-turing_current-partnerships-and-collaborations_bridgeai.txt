BridgeAI is an Innovate UK-funded programme with a mission to drive the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in sectors of the UK economy with high potential for growth for AI. The priority industries for the programme are transport, construction, agriculture, and the creative industries. By doing so, BridgeAI aims to promote AI-driven productivity and efficiency gains, which will support the UK's transition to an AI-enabled economy.
The programme focuses on these four target sectors to encourage collaboration and build meaningful relationships between UK-based AI developers and industry adopters. These relationships will enable knowledge sharing, support the development of new AI solutions to address sector-specific challenges, and address the technical and business skills gaps currently limiting the adoption of AI solutions. Sustainable and responsible AI innovation is also a core focus of the programme.
 
The Alan Turing Institute is a key partner in BridgeAI. The Turing will provide independent scientific advice to companies encountering challenges associated with AI adoption. The Turing harnesses the UK data science and AI community to accelerate the development of AI capabilities in the four target sectors through the delivery of online training tools, advice and bespoke training targeted to the needs of Bridge AI participating organisations as well as access to the Turing Way. The Turing will also provide standards expertise through access to the UK AI Standards hub, bespoke delivery of workshops on AI and develop standards road maps.
 
BridgeAI is a £100m investment in the UK’s future that will stimulate both AI demand and supply side engagement, develop end-user driven AI technologies and address systemic barriers limiting adoption.
