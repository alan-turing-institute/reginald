The UK government and parliament (2018 UK Parliament’s POST report on Robotics in Social Care) have identified the need to support research and innovation in the field of robotics and AI for health and social care. This is in response to the expected growth in needs for the ageing population, and the contribution AI and robotics technologies can offer.
This collaborative workshop will take place at the Alan Turing building at University of Manchester.
This workshop aims to achieve a shared awareness of the strengths and complementarity of UK and International projects and activities in this field, to identify the main research challenges, and foster interaction and collaboration. International experts will also be invited to share good practice and further support international collaboration.

Academic speakers include experts already involved in assistive robotics and AI projects, from the UK, EU and Japan. It will also have talks from experts in ethics and law for healthcare technologies and for responsible research and innovation. Participants will comprise stakeholders from charities, industry, and policy makers.
This workshop is sponsored by The Alan Turing Institute, the H2020 project MoveCare and CloudMinds.
