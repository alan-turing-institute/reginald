Grigorios is a Senior Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute. He is passionate about using data science to help solve difficult societal problems. He received his PhD from Imperial College London, where he co-designed MCMC algorithms and specialised hardware (FPGAs) to accelerate large-scale Bayesian inference.
He then worked as a data scientist in industry for three years, getting involved in a wide range of projects, from food waste minimisation and predictive maintenance to time series forecasting and dynamic price optimisation, while helping to build and train a large data science team.
At the Turing, Grigorios is keen to work collaboratively with stakeholders to understand research challenges, develop practical solutions and deliver high quality code.
He has been involved in projects that touch upon synthetic data generation, data privacy, multi-level MCMC algorithms and probabilistic programming. He is also the REG lead for the Urban Analytics area.
