Find out more about the expert commentary the Turing can provide
Governments around the world are committed to supporting the roll out of national digital IDs, but there are privacy and security implications associated with scaling these systems at a national level.
Responsible implementation of ID services is a critical enabler for financial inclusion; it enables access to services and enactment of civil rights. According to the World Bank, more than one billion people are currently living without an official digital identity.
The Alan Turing Institute is joining a vibrant community of NGOs, charities, private sector providers, universities and think tanks addressing global identity challenges in the digital age.
Questions of trust are based around the complex interplay of socio-technical considerations, requiring multi-disciplinary expertise. The ‘trustworthiness’ of digital IDs is characterised by multiple inter-related dimensions that include security, privacy, ethics, resilience, robustness and reliability. These dimensions are required to provide the knowledge, tools and guidance needed to implement privacy-preserving, secure identification systems
This initiative has received initial funding through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
The project aims to enhance the privacy and security of national digital identity systems, with the ultimate goal to maximise the value to beneficiaries, whilst limiting known and unknown risks to these constituents and maintaining the integrity of the overall system.
The project is comprised of three major workstreams:
This is a multi-disciplinary project bringing together skills from diverse fields such as threat modelling and red teaming, dynamic cyber security and real-time governance, risk modelling, cloud solutions/ID-as-a-service, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) and security policy development. Please see related opportunities here.
 
The Alan Turing Institute's Trustworthy Digital Identity Interest Group brings together a vibrant, global community of over 100 practitioners and researchers. They meet regularly to host vital discussion and investigate the evolving technical and social risks, as well as to contribute towards the development of more trustworthy systems.
