Emily Jesper-Mir is a Partnerships and Engagement Manager within Data for Science and Health, where she shares the role with Rebecca Asher. She joined Wellcome in 2020 as a Strategy and Engagement Manager for Understanding Patient Data, a program that has since moved to NHS Confederation as of April 2023.
Emily's work focuses on the potential benefits of data science and digital technologies for improving people's health, while also acknowledging the risks and unintended harms that may arise. She supports, devises, and funds work that takes into account the needs, views, and aspirations of the communities involved in developing, using, and affected by new tools and ways of using data.
Emily is dedicated to ensuring that patients' voices and the public interest are at the heart of data science research, policy, and practice. She advocates for engagement that involves people from diverse backgrounds and creative, inclusive ways of having conversations as part of building trusted relationships.
Before joining Wellcome in 2020, Emily worked as a Partnership Director at Sense about Science, a charity that stands up for the public interest in sound science and evidence. Alongside Rebecca Asher, she led SaS' public engagement program, which helped researchers to communicate difficult evidence debates or health datasets simply and accurately through co-design and co-creation, such as the co-design of the INSIGHT HDRUK hub website with patients and the public. She was also involved in facilitating the co-design of a public resource: Data Science: a guide for society.. Emily joined Sense about Science following a successful career in scientific publishing.
