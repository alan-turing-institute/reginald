We are doing this through basic research into theoretical scientific problems, and through applying our cutting-edge science to real-world problems, and with recognition of the important legal, ethical and societal implications of these technologies.
We channel our research around a number of ambitious challenges which represent areas in which AI and data science can have a game-changing impact for science, society, and the economy. These challenges will not be led by the Turing alone, but depend on significant collaboration and partnerships.
The Institute's research spans a huge range of disciplines and expertise. See the (still expanding) list of research areas and explore snapshots of projects, people, events and more.
A grand challenge-led approach for Turing’s science and innovation agenda provides the common focus, clear direction and a mandate to prioritise activity, as well as the inspiration and motivation for diverse communities and capabilities to come together in support of these organising principles. In alignment with national priority areas, we have selected the following areas of focus for grand challenges:
The ‘digital society’ could help to address systemic productivity issues. It could also lead to the provision of more inclusive, fair and robust services. Using our unique position and established expertise, we can tap into the enormous potential for data science and AI to drive a new generation of public services which are efficient, smart and responsive to both complexity and uncertainty. Similarly, advances could improve resilience and economic security through real-time monitoring of the economy, its financial systems, and supply chains.   
The Turing will draw and expand on its established capability and partnerships in public policy and data-driven economics to drive this work forward.  We will focus on the impact of digitisation on business, finance, the measurement of the economy and cross-cutting issues of standards, regulation, ethics and policy. 
To drive advances in the Grand challenge areas, multi-faceted core capabilities are required to provide the underpinning infrastructure, this will involve: 
Core capabilities
Building our foundational capability in data science and AI in support of the above Grand Challenges.
Core capabilities
Expanding our work in the development and provision of open-source infrastructure that is accessible to all.
Core capabilities
Growing our core research software engineering capability to continue to contribute skills in research software engineering and data science in support of national priorities.
Core capabilities
Expanding our capability through Research Application Managers and Community Managers to support translation of our communities’ science and innovation activity.
Together, The Alan Turing Institute and its partners have invested more than £26m in digital twin research and innovation across a range of projects, including developing foundational theory and applications in the engineering, environmental and social sciences. This represents one of the largest and most exciting portfolios of academic digital twin research and innovation in the UK. To build on this activity, we are now establishing a new Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins.

Significant programmes of strategic research, typically led by a Programme Director or Directors and with involvement from industry, public sector or third sector partners.
Focused scientific study, led by Turing researchers, working with other academics and often industry collaborators, towards defined objectives. Turing research projects aim to be multidisciplinary and multi-institutional, delivering both scientific and real-world impact. 
Institute researchers have set up interest groups to drive collaboration in shared topics in data science. Contact group organisers to get involved or find out more.
