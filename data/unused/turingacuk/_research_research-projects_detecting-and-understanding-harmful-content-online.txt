This project aims to systematise research in online harms (e.g. research on hate speech). It will do this by developing lists of datasets and benchmarks to compare different attempts to solve the problem (e.g. benchmarks to compare different hate speech classifiers), and developing guidelines for practitioners who wish to use the outputs of online harms research (e.g. government or policy experts who want to develop a quantitative understanding of hate speech in a certain context).
The project will produce three outcomes: 
In summary, this project aims to create 'meta tools' - tools and best practices for using or combining existing tools for detecting and understanding online harms.                
hatespeechdata.com is a website which collects together several known datasets related to hate speech online. This is expected to serve as a resource for researchers in the area.
