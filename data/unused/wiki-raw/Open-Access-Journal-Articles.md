The Turing has access to a block grant to cover open access charges for journal publications if there are not already funds in the project-specific grant to cover them. If you have published an article, you may be able to cover the open access fees using this funding source -- [there is a form on Turing Complete to apply for this funding](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=743bfbfbfa7a49528b0f23c1503270b9), along with information about the criteria for obtaining funding from this source. Review of this form is done by the PMU, so please direct questions to Catherine Lawrence or the appropriate PMU contact for the programme associated with your project.
