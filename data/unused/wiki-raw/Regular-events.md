This is a page for adding information and times about regular events that occur in REG and across the Turing. This page is a work in progress so add/delete events as required.

There are also slack channels available for a lot of events and organising too.

- [Tech Talks](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/#tech-talks)
    - [Tech talk schedule and sign-up](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/DataScienceSkills/wiki/Lunchtime-Tech-Talks)

Weekly talks where someone (usually someone in REG) presents or discusses something, such as about a project or data science/computer science/software engineering topic.

- [Reading and Discussion Groups](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/#reading--discussion-groups)

As part of projects or separately for general interest, members of the team create reading groups to learn about a topic. Reading groups may meet on weekly basis to discuss a chapter from a book, a paper, or to work together on implementing something, for example. Examples of current & past groups include:
- Reinforcement Learning reading group
- Bitcoin reading group
- Humanities & Data Science discussion group
- Bayesian reading group
- Category Theory Reading Group

The contact details for these groups are in [[The REGistry|The-REGistry]]

There is also a non-work based Bookclub that runs as well. This can be found on slack as #bookclub.


- All REG Meetings
Roughly once a month we have an all-REG meeting where we welcome new joiners and a few people briefly present news from around REG or the Turing. If you don’t have the calendar invites (new joiners might not initially) ask someone else in the team to forward them to you.

More information on [Turing Events](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/#turing-events) can be found here.
The main focus of this page is what we do in REG, but there are many things happening around the Turing that REG members are also encouraged to attend, including:

-Turing Catchups & Town Halls
Regular meetings open to all staff with updates from around the institute. New starters may not have the calendar invites initially - ask others in the team to forward the details if you’re unsure.
[Turing Events](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events) - often public talks & workshops.

-Hack Week
In June 2022, REG ran a Hack Week for the week. The team worked across 4-5 projects that were suggested by the team throughout the week, concluding with progress updates at the end of the week.

Full details on the week and how this was run is available here (add link).
