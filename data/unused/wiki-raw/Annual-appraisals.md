_2023-05-16: Wiki page first created for the 2022-23 process (we've previously used dedicated issues and discussion topics for each year). Only small changes from the [2021-22 process](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/discussions/1178). Only substantive changes are the change from a 1-5 scale to a 1-3 scale for scoring objectives and qualities in Cezanne and updates to the timeline dates to reflect this years deadlines._

## Context
REG is a large team, with a relatively flat line management structure. Therefore we run a team-wide standardisation process where appraisals and progression award recommendations are reviewed to ensure consistency and fairness across the team.

Our goal is to work within the wider HR policy and guidance (see [2022-23 HR performance review guide](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=PerformanceReviewGuide22-23.pdf&fileguid=945dbb37-769f-41b0-8f2b-72dc540692dd)) to prioritise what we think is most important for our team (fairness, transparency and a clear progression path) and provide clear guidance to achieve that.

#### Principles
1. REG folk who are operating at an equivalent level should receive equivalent pay.
2. We are a learning team and our default assumption is that people will generally be growing and developing in their role as they gain more experience.
3. Everyone who is performing _and developing_ as expected for their role and their experience level within it should expect to progress through their pay band each year on top of the cost of living adjustment. This is very much in line with the guidance on salary increases from HR (see below).

>**HR guidance:** A salary increase should be recommended to acknowledge an improvement in the skills and experience that the individual has gained over the last performance year i.e. they are performing better in the role than they were this time last year.

#### Mechanism
- All team members who have been performing and developing as expected for their experience level will receive the same "small" progression increase in pay each year above the cost of living increase. The actual percentage increase this corresponds to is set by HR each year but the expectation is that, if performing and developing as expected each year, you would progress from the bottom to the top of your band in around 6-8 years. This is in line with the expected progression rate in the university spine point system.
- Exceptionally, where someone has progressed _significantly_ more than what would reasonably be expected, a further adjustment may be made to ensure that Principle 1 still holds.
- Where someone has been promoted within the year, they will already have received their progression pay increase for the year at promotion and no further progression increase will be awarded at appraisal time.
- In the rare cases someone in the team is not performing or developing as expected, no progression increase will be awarded. This situation should be managed via ongoing support throughout the year. In general, this should not be a surprise at appraisal time.
- Team members who are at the top of their pay band are not eligible for a progression pay rise, but they are eligible for a bonus if consistently performing at a high level.
    - > HR guidance: the employee is at the top of the banding for the role but consistently performs at a high level (one of the example reasons for recommending a recognition award)

## Guidance notes
- We use our objectives and the discussions about progress against them in 1-2-1s and at year end appraisal time to:
    - Help identify the important things to focus on and prioritise
    - Recognise where we are spending our effort and reflect on how we are doing in this work
    - Help evaluate how we are performing and developing in our roles
- The last of these helps inform what a fair progression award will be for each person, helping us identify whether each individual is in the default "progressing as expected" group or in one of the exception groups that are significantly over- or under-performing against expectations.
- The appraisal process at the Turing involves each employee and their line manager assessing them against objectives set at the start of the year and personal qualities important to the institute. These are assessed on the following scale.
    -  1: Fails to meet expected level
    -  2: Meets expected level
    -  3: Exceeds expected level
- The most important purpose of the appraisal discussion and scoring is as a tool to look back on the year and reflect on what went well, what went not so well and what we would like to change or focus on in the coming year. However, there is often some tension when scoring objectives and qualities due to concerns about the impact of the overall score on the recommendation for a progression pay rise or bonus.
- We will be asking REG line managers to make an overall judgement on whether each of their reports is performing and developing broadly as expected given their experience level, considering the "year in review" appraisal discussion they have with each report and, where useful, discussions with other team members who have insight into their work over the year.
- For most people, the answer will be that they have been progressing broadly as expected for their experience level and their line manager will recommend a "small" progression pay rise.
- During last year's appraisal process everyone's pay was reviewed to ensure that that Principle 1 held after applying the progression pay rises. Therefore, we are as confident as we can be that everyone started the appraisal year performing and developing as expected for their position in their pay band.
- If, during the course of the year, there has been a substantive positive change in the person's ability to perform the role which means that they are no longer aligned with their peers at an equivalent level, then a "medium" (or "large") pay rise _might_ be warranted.
- If a person's performance and development does not reflect a substantive and sustained increase that justifies an additional pay rise to adjust their alignment with their peers, but there is a specific one-off contribution that significantly exceeds the expectations for their experience level, a one-off bonus might be warranted.
    - >**HR guidance:** The purpose of recognition awards is to recognise a piece of work or specific contribution from the past performance year which has added value to the team and wider organisation.
- If, during the course of the year, a person has not being performing or developing as expected, no progression pay rise will be awarded.
- Team members who are at the top of their pay band are not eligible for a progression pay rise, but they are eligible for a bonus if consistently performing at a high level.
    - >**HR guidance:** the employee is at the top of the banding for the role but consistently performs at a high level _(one of the example reasons for recommending a recognition award)_
- Team members who have been promoted within the past 6 months will not receive a progression pay rise at appraisal time as they will have already received a progression pay rise this year as part of their promotion. They will however be eligible for a bonus if there is a particular thing they did that year that significantly exceeded the expectations for their role.
    - >**HR guidance:** Staff who have been promoted within 6 months of a performance review cycle will not be eligible for further salary increases but are eligible for a recognition award.
- Team members who have not completed probation will not be eligible for a progression pay rise or bonus, but their pay will be reviewed at the end of probation to ensure that Principle 1 continues to hold.
- Team members who completed probation after 31 December will usually not undergo the appraisal process in Cezanne as they will only recently have completed their end of probation review (which for REG also includes a salary review (see the [[Probation Review]] page for details). However, they will have a similar "year in review" discussion with their line manager, reflecting and evaluating on their "rest of year" objectives set at the end of their appraisal.

## The process
See [Cezanne appraisal workflow](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=Cezanne+Performance+Management+Workflow+22-23.pdf&fileguid=fd97f879-6adb-475d-85d1-fa25885c0276) for details of the system workflow covering steps 1-2. **Please print a PDF of all Cezanne forms prior to submission as it has proved tricky to get these afterwards**

1. Team members complete self-assessment appraisal and share with their line manager. We would suggest team members have a discussion with their line managers about their self-assessment before submitting it on Cezanne, but the self-assessment should reflect the team member's view.
2. Following a discussion with their reports about their self-assessment, line managers complete their assessment, submitting the assessment form and associated progression award recommendation in Cezanne by the **Wednesday 31st May 2023** deadline for those who are doing the appraisal process on Cezanne.
3. Line managers send REG director PDFs of their appraisal forms and progression award recommendations by **Thursday 1st June 2023**.
5. REG director and principals meet on **Wednesday 7th June 2023** to review progression pay rise and bonus recommendations for consistency, making adjustments to come up with an overall set of standardised recommendations for the team that ensure that performance and development are recognised and that Principal 1 continues to hold.
6. REG director will share any adjustments to line manager's recommendations arising from the REG standardisation process with line managers, who will have an opportunity to discuss these.
7. REG director will share the standardised recommendations with the salary review panel (COO, Director of People)
8. REG director will attend the Turing-wide Salary Review Panel on **[2023 date TBC]** to answer any questions the panel have. The panel will have both the pre-standardisation line manager recommendations and the post-standardisation REG panel recommendations, so any differences will be discussed and justified to the panel.
9. The recommendations from the Salary Review Panel will then go the the Remuneration Committee (REPCo - a sub-committee of the Board of Trustees) for final approval. REPCo meet on **[2023 date TBC]**.
10. Any pay rises will be  effective from 1st July and first applied in the July payroll. One-off recognition awards will be also paid in the July payroll run.

The goal is that, between the principles and process outlined above, the REG standardisation panel and the Turing salary review panel, we will stand the best chance possible of ensuring that people progress in their role in a fair and transparent manner while ensuring that REG folk who are operating at an equivalent level continue to receive equivalent pay (Principle 1).
