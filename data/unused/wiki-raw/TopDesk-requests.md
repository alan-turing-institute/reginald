You should know whether you are part of a team that answers topdesk tickets - if you receive one it should be for a good reason.

If you receive an email to deal with a TopDesk request (e.g. `The following C1234-567 has been assigned to you and requires your
 action.`) follow these steps:

## Types of requests

1. Adding Turing people to the Github organisation: this is the most common request and one for
   whoever is part of the Researcher Tool Management Service Role.

2. Requests clearly not for REG: see whether you can find details on Turing Complete. For example, we received a ticket with the ethics approval for a project, detailed in [this TuringComplete page](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=cb5e35246f474d1f90abae8ea262338c), which lists the Ethics Advisory Group as contact point. If there is an existing appropriate
group / team within TopDesk then please allocate to the group rather than a specific individual.

## Steps to follow

1. Click the link on the email. Alternatively, go to `turingcomplete.topdesk.com`,
login as Operator, and search for the ticket number, e.g. C1901-128 in the top left.

2. Near the bottom left under `Processing`, the Operator Group should already be
REG, which is why it came to us.  Change the Operator according to the type of request.

3. You can then type a quick message to the caller in the text box at the right, or check the
box `Make invisible to caller` on top of it.

4. Click `Save` at the top right. An email draft appears.

5. Change the email recipient at the top left to the operator's email when assigning to a specific individual to avoid another email going to all of REG.

6. Click `Send` at the top right.
