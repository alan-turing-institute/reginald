## Meetings, calls and screen sharing

## Gather

REG uses Gather for some of the coffee breaks and social events. It gives a virtual space (modelled on the office!) to wander around and have conversations with people near to you.

- The space can be accessed at https://gather.town/app/EJPBD8kYqtVZYCDv/turing
- The password is: `hut23`

Note: Gather is blocked on the Turing VPN and on IT-managed computers.


### Zoom

Unless requested from IT, you will have a ""Basic"" Zoom account.  This allows you to create meetings for up to 40 minutes (unlimited for meetings with only 2 people).  For meetings longer than this, an upgrade to a ""Pro"" account is needed. To request a pro account email ITservices@turing.ac.uk (if you have problems let Martin know).

We have a persistent REG Zoom meeting room, which we use for things like coffee breaks, tech talks and co-working. This is the link: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/356411961?pwd=Tjloa2t0OHFzUGVaNG9xRmxxSGVxZz09

For larger events or meetings, Zoom also has some features for Webinars and breakout rooms.

Zoom Rooms (like those associated with each meeting room in the office) are persistent virtual meeting spaces.  Additional rooms might be able to be requested from IT if required (these seem to be priced at £32/month, so some justification should be given).

[Zoom TopDesk page](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=e63d1edd1cdc4e8ab3ac3c4e75bb768f)

### Teams

Note: We mostly use Zoom for meetings and Slack for messaging in REG, but others at the Turing use Teams more heavily (e.g. the business team), and some projects have meetings there.

- Get it from https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads (there is also a mobile app)
- Make calls, group calls and share screen straightforwardly within the app.
- You can find your VoIP number by looking at your ""My Office profile"" (office.com, then click your profile picture)
  - Ask IT for one if you don't have one
- Calls to this number will ring in the Teams app

#### Some notes on using Teams

Teams has several ways to share text and/or live voice and video with others:
- calls
- chats
- meetings

Calls and chats are between you and one or more of your ""contacts"".  You can put your contacts into ""groups"", which are distinct from ""teams"".

The most versatile option is a **meeting**.  The way to make one of these in the Teams app is on the *calendar* tab (obviously!).  It must be associated with a calendar event, and can be joined by people who are invited or by sharing a link.  The meeting itself has a chat associated with it.  It exists before and after the duration of the meeting, so can be used to set up persistent meeting spaces.


## Wellbeing tips for remote working

Remote working brings different challenges. The work-life boundaries are less clear and some people struggle with lack of connection. Here we collate tips that the group has found to positively impact their wellbeing while working remotely. At the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdowns, having wellbeing tips proved really useful, see below:
For more information on Wellbeing in REG, go to the wellbeing page. (LINK)

- **Delineate the start and end of the working day.** A huge challenge is separating the working day from life outside of work, especially if both happen in the same location. Suggestions that might help bound work to working hours:
    - Simulate a commute to allow your brain to switch off. For example, go for a 20 minute walk, run, or read a book.
    - Have separate _work_ clothes and _non-work_ clothes.
    - Tidy your laptop/screen away if you are using the same space for relaxation
    - If possible use a different device for leisure activity to your work machine.
- **Finish on time.** Without the impetus of having colleagues around you clocking off it seems easy to work later than usual and eat into your relaxation time. Take a 1hr lunch break, and finished on time. If you are finding that you are repeatedly doing this then there is an issue with your workload that needs corrected. Reach out!
- **Talk**. Many of us have missed the casual connection you get with being around people, and when you are working alone it is easy to forget the you are part of a team. This point is just a reminder that you work in a team that genuinely cares about the wellbeing of every member of the group.

Buddy-Sign-up-and-Matches.md,"# REG Buddy Sign Up Sheet

This page is for organising sign-ups and matches to REG's [Buddy-System](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/buddy_system/). Everyone new-starter gets two REG buddies. In Jan 2022 we also had one external buddy. This helps to enforce that 'Turing' is bigger than 'REG'. External buddying is a little more social in nature, whereas internal buddies can wear both hats and also may offer informal technical help. However, note that the external buddying needs to be bidirectional and historically there hasn't been many volunteers from REG to the wider Turing, so external buddying should be considered an optional nice-to-have.

If your preference for being a buddy has changed, please contact the person in charge of onboarding [wiki page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/wiki/Onboarding).

Please add your name below if you'd like to be considered as a buddy for a new starter.

## Matches

The only constraints to being a buddy are that the buddy is not the line manager or on the new-starters first project. Preferably, at least one REG buddy will also be available on the morning of the first day to great the new-starter.

# Acknowledging Turing Funding

If you write a paper or another publication, you should cite Turing funding as follows:

* The Alan Turing Institute’s core funding is EPSRC grant EP/N510129/1. This is what to use when there is no more specific grant. Strictly speaking Turing Fellow projects are funded from the university partner contributions, but the core grant still covers overheads. I think we should generally reference this grant, even where we also reference a more specific grant, unless a project pays full economic cost (i.e. full direct + full overheads).

* ASG work is funded by the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund “AI for Science, Engineering, Health and Government” grant (EP/T001569/1), particularly the “<inset-theme-naqme-here” theme within that grant.

# Writing tips

## Books

A collection of books some of us found useful to get better at writing:

- **The Elements of Style** by Strunk and White
- **Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace** by Williams and Bizup
- **The Pyramid Principle:Logic in Writing and Thinking** by Minto
- **On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Non-Fiction** by Zinsser

Some of them should be already available at the Turing.

"
Projects-and-staffing.org,"** How we currently manage our portfolio of projects

1. For *overall project management* we use [[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2][the `Project Tracker']], a kanban board
   attached to the hut23 repository on GitHub. (Confusingly, GitHub calls a
   kanban board a “Project.”)  Each project gets a GitHub “issue,” which comes
   with an auto-generated issue number. The issue number is the primary means of
   individuating projects within REG.

   Each of the issues lives in a particular column of the kanban board
   representing the present stage of the project. We currently have ten stages for a project, which are described below.

   | Stage | Name                   | Description                                   |
   |-------+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
   |     1 | Suggested              | Someone heard a rumour                        |
   |     2 | Proposal               | Someone is writing a proposal                 |
   |     3 | Project brief complete | We have received a project brief to consider  |
   |     4 | With funder            | Appoved by REG; awaiting funding confirmation |
   |     5 | Finding resources      | REG is finding individuals to assign          |
   |     6 | Awaiting start         | Project is ready to go                        |
   |     7 | Active                 |                                               |
   |     8 | Completion review      | We don't do this as much as we should         |
   |     9 | Done                   |                                               |
   |    10 | Cancelled              |                                               |

   Within the issue itself we maintain metadata about the projects---the people
   involved, the total budget and timing constraints---as well as a
   chronological record of communications about the project. We also use the
   issue as a place to attach team members’ preferences. None of this metadata
   is easily parsed by machine, although we have recently made efforts to add,
   at the top of the issue, [[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project.md][a metadata block]] containing the critical information
   for each project.

2. For *scheduling* and *billing* we use [[https://forecastapp.com/974183/schedule/projects][Forecast]]. Roughly speaking, this
   web-based service maintains a list of /assigments/: that is, allocations of
   an individual's time to a project over a given period. Since Forecast records
   what we ought to be spending our time on, we also use it for billing. When we
   come to to decide how much to charge projects we look at the past
   allocations in Forecast.

   We have also used Forecast to try to schedule projects as well as individual
   assignments. However, this is complicated by the fact that there is no
   ""project budget"" facility in Forecast. There is no place to record start and
   end dates or resourcing needs for projects that are not yet staffed. (This is
   why this information is in the Project Tracker.) We have found a work-around
   by assigning a nominal staff member (known as a “Placeholder”) called
   “Resource required”. When a real team-member is assigned to the project, the
   “resource required” person is removed. However, this approach has been made
   more difficult by the decision to move to staffing levels that are not
   necessarily multiples of 50% of an FTE.

3. For historic *time tracking* we use [[https://thealanturinginstitute.harvestapp.com/time/week][Harvest]], a system linked to Forecast.

We have tried to use Harvest to track our /actual/ time, including various
   duties that are not billed to projects because they are part of ""business as
   usual.""  Every once in a while we review Harvest to ensure that what we said
   we were going to do (in Forecast) is roughly what we actually did. If there
   are large discrepancies, we discuss these and if necessary change Forecast
   retroactively to match reality.


In addition, we have written a number of scripts under the collective name
“[[https://wimbledon-planner.azurewebsites.net/][project Wimbledon]].” These (a) summarise staffing allocations by project and
person, to some extent reproducing the board in a way that allows us to print it
out on a very large sheet of paper; (b) collect in one place the individual
preferences; (c) produce a forward look of supply against demand.

Shared-REG-Calendar.md,"# Shared REG Calendar

We can use the calendar associated with sharepoint group `Research Engineering` for events we want the whole team to know about. You should already belong to this group (see [Systems set up](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/new_joiners/systems_set_up/#office-365-groups)).


## Viewing the calendar

In outlook calendar view, `Research Engineering` will be listed under `Groups`. If you keep this ticked then the shared calendar entries will appear alongisde your existing calendars.
![](https://i.imgur.com/O9hw61N.png)

If you also want to view the shared calendar in the default macOS Calendar app:

1. Open the Calendar app, then go to Settings > Accounts > Delegation
2. Click the '+' sign and in the 'Users' field, select `Research Engineering (hut23@turing.ac.uk)` (you can just type hut23 and choose it from the dropdown).
3. Once that is added, make sure that the checkbox under the 'Show' field is ticked.
4. The shared calendar should then be visible under 'Delegations' in the left-hand sidebar.


## Making Editable calendar entries.

If you want to make a calendar entry that other REG members can edit you should do this from the calendar view with the `Research Engineering` calendar selected (as in the screenshot). Anyone else in the `Research Engineering` group will be able to view and edit the entry (since `Research Engineering` will be the owner of the event).

Note that invites to the group will only be sent out if you add, to the attendees, the `Research Engineering` group, or `hut23@turing.ac.uk` (the email associated with the sharepoint group).

## Making Read-only calendar entries.

If you want to add read-only calendar entries, you can invite `hut23@turing.ac.uk`, the email associated with the group `Research Engineering`, to your event from your own calendar (i.e. so you, not `Research Engineering`, is the owner). Inviting `hut23@turing.ac.uk` will send an invite out to all members of the sharepoint group.

"
Regular-events.md,"This is a page for adding information and times about regular events that occur in REG and across the Turing. This page is a work in progress so add/delete events as required.

There are also slack channels available for a lot of events and organising too.

- [Tech Talks](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/#tech-talks)
    - [Tech talk schedule and sign-up](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/DataScienceSkills/wiki/Lunchtime-Tech-Talks)

Weekly talks where someone (usually someone in REG) presents or discusses something, such as about a project or data science/computer science/software engineering topic.

- [Reading and Discussion Groups](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/#reading--discussion-groups)

As part of projects or separately for general interest, members of the team create reading groups to learn about a topic. Reading groups may meet on weekly basis to discuss a chapter from a book, a paper, or to work together on implementing something, for example. Examples of current & past groups include:
- Reinforcement Learning reading group
- Bitcoin reading group
- Humanities & Data Science discussion group
- Bayesian reading group
- Category Theory Reading Group

The contact details for these groups are in [[The REGistry|The-REGistry]]

There is also a non-work based Bookclub that runs as well. This can be found on slack as #bookclub.


- All REG Meetings
Roughly once a month we have an all-REG meeting where we welcome new joiners and a few people briefly present news from around REG or the Turing. If you don’t have the calendar invites (new joiners might not initially) ask someone else in the team to forward them to you.

More information on [Turing Events](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/#turing-events) can be found here.
The main focus of this page is what we do in REG, but there are many things happening around the Turing that REG members are also encouraged to attend, including:

-Turing Catchups & Town Halls
Regular meetings open to all staff with updates from around the institute. New starters may not have the calendar invites initially - ask others in the team to forward the details if you’re unsure.
[Turing Events](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events) - often public talks & workshops.

-Hack Week
In June 2022, REG ran a Hack Week for the week. The team worked across 4-5 projects that were suggested by the team throughout the week, concluding with progress updates at the end of the week.

Full details on the week and how this was run is available here (add link). "
Data-science:-A-syllabus.md,"A page to capture ideas for a “data science” syllabus, suitable for a course or a reference, that could be given to new joiners in REG. Very much a work in progress.

Timesheet-Codes.md,"# Our Approach to Timesheets

1. Timesheets should match Forecast.

   That is, if you are “100%” on projects, and have no service role activity, then your timesheet records 100% time on projects. For example, Town Hall meetings (which by the way is [standing role no. 617, Corporate Duties: Professional Activities not elsewhere specified](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/8)) would in general not be recorded on the timesheet.

2. However, if your other duties are taking up an inordinate amount of your time then you are very much at liberty to so record them in order to enable any conversations you would like to have about the issue. That is, the timesheet is also to help you push back if you would like.

3. However, in addition, we should (again, if you like!) record any activity in support of a Programme Support Role, Turing Service Area, or REG Service Area (like training) even if you are not explicitly assigned to that role so that we can start to figure out how much time these things really take up.

Remember again that Timesheets are to help us, they are not the source of truth for charging projects. We'd prefer that they reflect reality, rather than anything we have promised. But we don’t want them to be so fine-grained that they take up all our time to fill out. So, in particular: time allocated to projects includes a reasonable amount for corporate duties. Thus we don’t bother explicitly recording the corporate duties unless they become unreasonable.

Our actual process is: we charge projects based on Forecast, having made sure that there aren’t any glaring discrepancies with Harvest. (eg, a project starting a month late.)

# Which Project should I use for which activity?

This page describes where to find your project on Harvest. Every project on Harvest is labelled with a GitHub issue number, in the form `hut23-999`, so you want to find the project with the correct issue number.

## My project is a project

You should able find the project under the appropriate Client.

The issue number corresponds to the project as listed in [the project tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2) or possibly in [the 22 days project list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/4). (There may be other places but all projects have an issue number.)

## My project is Programme Support, Service Area, or other activity

All Programme Support roles and Service Area roles are listed on the [Standing Roles kanban board](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/8). The columns in that board each have their own Client on Harvest, where you should look for the particular role. Again, all the Harvest projects should be labelled with the appropriate issue number.

The clients are:
- Turing Programme Support
- Turing Service Areas
- REG Service Areas
- Corporate Duties
- Personal Time

## Tips

### Advice on printing via CUPS (the Common Unix Printing System, used by MacOS)

```
lpr -T ""Gargleblaster"" -o InputSlot=Tray3 -o XRAFinisherStapleOption=True -o XRFinishing=Staple -o XRStapleOpti
on=1Staple -o XRStapleLocation=TopLeft -o XRAnnotationOption=Standard temp/*.pdf
```

Print all pdfs in `temp`, stapling the lot, and add a small annotation saying ""Gargleblaster"" in the top left.

(NB: The default input tray is `Tray1` but this is A3 paper on our printers.)

### Printing A3, double sided etc.

To get additional print settings like these have a look at the instructions here:

The office also has a stationary cupboard with the usual office supplies.

The-New-Recharge-Reporting-Process-(May-2022).md,"This page documents the first run of the ""new"" process whereby REG's allocations to projects eventually end up in the Finance system. There are three steps (and several sub-steps that are not shown):

1. After month end, REG produce a ""recharge _pro forma_"" for the month

2. PMU sign off this pro forma.

3. Finance upload the allocations.

## 1. Recharge _pro forma_

1. Oliver created [`regolith`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/regolith), a Racket script for producing a monthly summary from Forecast.

2. James G used `regolith` to manually produce a _pro forma_ for April. That involved:
   - deleting all months other than April
   - deleting rows with no allocation
   - adding columns for PMU sign-off, proposed edits, and REG sign-off for the edits
   - adding an instructions sheet

3. James G asked Catherine L who from PMU should be REG's working contact.

Annual-appraisals.md,"_2023-05-16: Wiki page first created for the 2022-23 process (we've previously used dedicated issues and discussion topics for each year). Only small changes from the [2021-22 process](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/discussions/1178). Only substantive changes are the change from a 1-5 scale to a 1-3 scale for scoring objectives and qualities in Cezanne and updates to the timeline dates to reflect this years deadlines._

## Context
REG is a large team, with a relatively flat line management structure. Therefore we run a team-wide standardisation process where appraisals and progression award recommendations are reviewed to ensure consistency and fairness across the team.

Our goal is to work within the wider HR policy and guidance (see [2022-23 HR performance review guide](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=PerformanceReviewGuide22-23.pdf&fileguid=945dbb37-769f-41b0-8f2b-72dc540692dd)) to prioritise what we think is most important for our team (fairness, transparency and a clear progression path) and provide clear guidance to achieve that.

#### Principles
1. REG folk who are operating at an equivalent level should receive equivalent pay.
2. We are a learning team and our default assumption is that people will generally be growing and developing in their role as they gain more experience.
3. Everyone who is performing _and developing_ as expected for their role and their experience level within it should expect to progress through their pay band each year on top of the cost of living adjustment. This is very much in line with the guidance on salary increases from HR (see below).

>**HR guidance:** A salary increase should be recommended to acknowledge an improvement in the skills and experience that the individual has gained over the last performance year i.e. they are performing better in the role than they were this time last year.

#### Mechanism
- All team members who have been performing and developing as expected for their experience level will receive the same ""small"" progression increase in pay each year above the cost of living increase. The actual percentage increase this corresponds to is set by HR each year but the expectation is that, if performing and developing as expected each year, you would progress from the bottom to the top of your band in around 6-8 years. This is in line with the expected progression rate in the university spine point system.
- Exceptionally, where someone has progressed _significantly_ more than what would reasonably be expected, a further adjustment may be made to ensure that Principle 1 still holds.
- Where someone has been promoted within the year, they will already have received their progression pay increase for the year at promotion and no further progression increase will be awarded at appraisal time.
- In the rare cases someone in the team is not performing or developing as expected, no progression increase will be awarded. This situation should be managed via ongoing support throughout the year. In general, this should not be a surprise at appraisal time.
- Team members who are at the top of their pay band are not eligible for a progression pay rise, but they are eligible for a bonus if consistently performing at a high level.
    - > HR guidance: the employee is at the top of the banding for the role but consistently performs at a high level (one of the example reasons for recommending a recognition award)

## Guidance notes
- We use our objectives and the discussions about progress against them in 1-2-1s and at year end appraisal time to:
    - Help identify the important things to focus on and prioritise
    - Recognise where we are spending our effort and reflect on how we are doing in this work
    - Help evaluate how we are performing and developing in our roles
- The last of these helps inform what a fair progression award will be for each person, helping us identify whether each individual is in the default ""progressing as expected"" group or in one of the exception groups that are significantly over- or under-performing against expectations.
- The appraisal process at the Turing involves each employee and their line manager assessing them against objectives set at the start of the year and personal qualities important to the institute. These are assessed on the following scale.
    -  1: Fails to meet expected level
    -  2: Meets expected level
    -  3: Exceeds expected level
- The most important purpose of the appraisal discussion and scoring is as a tool to look back on the year and reflect on what went well, what went not so well and what we would like to change or focus on in the coming year. However, there is often some tension when scoring objectives and qualities due to concerns about the impact of the overall score on the recommendation for a progression pay rise or bonus.
- We will be asking REG line managers to make an overall judgement on whether each of their reports is performing and developing broadly as expected given their experience level, considering the ""year in review"" appraisal discussion they have with each report and, where useful, discussions with other team members who have insight into their work over the year.
- For most people, the answer will be that they have been progressing broadly as expected for their experience level and their line manager will recommend a ""small"" progression pay rise.
- During last year's appraisal process everyone's pay was reviewed to ensure that that Principle 1 held after applying the progression pay rises. Therefore, we are as confident as we can be that everyone started the appraisal year performing and developing as expected for their position in their pay band.
- If, during the course of the year, there has been a substantive positive change in the person's ability to perform the role which means that they are no longer aligned with their peers at an equivalent level, then a ""medium"" (or ""large"") pay rise _might_ be warranted.
- If a person's performance and development does not reflect a substantive and sustained increase that justifies an additional pay rise to adjust their alignment with their peers, but there is a specific one-off contribution that significantly exceeds the expectations for their experience level, a one-off bonus might be warranted.
    - >**HR guidance:** The purpose of recognition awards is to recognise a piece of work or specific contribution from the past performance year which has added value to the team and wider organisation.
- If, during the course of the year, a person has not being performing or developing as expected, no progression pay rise will be awarded.
- Team members who are at the top of their pay band are not eligible for a progression pay rise, but they are eligible for a bonus if consistently performing at a high level.
    - >**HR guidance:** the employee is at the top of the banding for the role but consistently performs at a high level _(one of the example reasons for recommending a recognition award)_
- Team members who have been promoted within the past 6 months will not receive a progression pay rise at appraisal time as they will have already received a progression pay rise this year as part of their promotion. They will however be eligible for a bonus if there is a particular thing they did that year that significantly exceeded the expectations for their role.
    - >**HR guidance:** Staff who have been promoted within 6 months of a performance review cycle will not be eligible for further salary increases but are eligible for a recognition award.
- Team members who have not completed probation will not be eligible for a progression pay rise or bonus, but their pay will be reviewed at the end of probation to ensure that Principle 1 continues to hold.
- Team members who completed probation after 31 December will usually not undergo the appraisal process in Cezanne as they will only recently have completed their end of probation review (which for REG also includes a salary review (see the [[Probation Review]] page for details). However, they will have a similar ""year in review"" discussion with their line manager, reflecting and evaluating on their ""rest of year"" objectives set at the end of their appraisal.

## The process
See [Cezanne appraisal workflow](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=Cezanne+Performance+Management+Workflow+22-23.pdf&fileguid=fd97f879-6adb-475d-85d1-fa25885c0276) for details of the system workflow covering steps 1-2. **Please print a PDF of all Cezanne forms prior to submission as it has proved tricky to get these afterwards**

1. Team members complete self-assessment appraisal and share with their line manager. We would suggest team members have a discussion with their line managers about their self-assessment before submitting it on Cezanne, but the self-assessment should reflect the team member's view.
2. Following a discussion with their reports about their self-assessment, line managers complete their assessment, submitting the assessment form and associated progression award recommendation in Cezanne by the **Wednesday 31st May 2023** deadline for those who are doing the appraisal process on Cezanne.
3. Line managers send REG director PDFs of their appraisal forms and progression award recommendations by **Thursday 1st June 2023**.
5. REG director and principals meet on **Wednesday 7th June 2023** to review progression pay rise and bonus recommendations for consistency, making adjustments to come up with an overall set of standardised recommendations for the team that ensure that performance and development are recognised and that Principal 1 continues to hold.
6. REG director will share any adjustments to line manager's recommendations arising from the REG standardisation process with line managers, who will have an opportunity to discuss these.
7. REG director will share the standardised recommendations with the salary review panel (COO, Director of People)
8. REG director will attend the Turing-wide Salary Review Panel on **[2023 date TBC]** to answer any questions the panel have. The panel will have both the pre-standardisation line manager recommendations and the post-standardisation REG panel recommendations, so any differences will be discussed and justified to the panel.
9. The recommendations from the Salary Review Panel will then go the the Remuneration Committee (REPCo - a sub-committee of the Board of Trustees) for final approval. REPCo meet on **[2023 date TBC]**.
10. Any pay rises will be  effective from 1st July and first applied in the July payroll. One-off recognition awards will be also paid in the July payroll run.

The goal is that, between the principles and process outlined above, the REG standardisation panel and the Turing salary review panel, we will stand the best chance possible of ensuring that people progress in their role in a fair and transparent manner while ensuring that REG folk who are operating at an equivalent level continue to receive equivalent pay (Principle 1)."
Criteria-for-project-appraisal.md,"_aligned with Turing 2.0 and the Turing Charter_

## 1. Impact
_Make a positive change in the world_

The Institute works with an impact-first philosophy, focusing on research that is likely to make a positive change in the world. Impact in this context is understood broadly, from increased knowledge and understanding of the way we see and operate in the world, to increased efficiency resulting from the uptake of new tools and technologies. Impact also drives the way our project delivery is managed. In assessing project proposals requiring data scientist or research engineer effort, we will prioritise approaches and methodologies we are familiar with and confident that they can produce impactful results. Each project will be assigned a score based on the impact opportunities it presents and the likelihood of realising them.

## 2. Diversity
_Reflect and celebrate the diverse nature of the world_

In order to be able to change the world for the better, our research must be conducted by researchers from diverse academic, social, ethnical, racial backgrounds, and using a variety of theoretical frameworks, methodologies and categories of data. Diversity breeds creativity and enables discovery and innovation to flourish. This approach is matched at project delivery level by prioritizing projects building cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary collaborations or bringing partner institutions together. Project proposals involving purely theoretical research with academics, or consultancy-type work with commercial partners, or not welcoming external contributions from outside the REG, are unlikely to score high in the diversity assessment. Conversely, projects encouraging collaboration with culturally diverse academic and non-academic teams from beyond the Turing are likely to get higher marks.

## 3. Pioneering
_Explore new ways of tackling research, talent and approaches_

Turing research is solidly rooted in academic excellence, scientific evidence and trusted best practice. At the same time the Institute works creatively, encouraging new ideas and unprecedented approaches to pursue scientific excellence in addressing critical global challenges. Cross-pollination of ideas and practices leading to innovative results is encouraged in collaborative projects with academic, commercial and third sector delivery partners. Project briefs will need to specify to what extent the proposed approaches or methodologies are innovative in the context of similar research being undertaken elsewhere, and a pioneering score will be assigned to each of them.

## 4. Openness
_Share outputs and methodologies as openly as possible_

To ensure that our collaborative research reaches an audience as wide and diverse as possible, we believe both knowledge and the path to reaching it should be shared. Openness by default facilitates both research and software development collaboration. This extends the impact of our projects beyond the Institute, allowing outputs to be built upon by others and repurposed across domains. Whenever possible, we expect the projects we prioritise to undertake reproducible research, and the software jointly developed with us to be built and released as open source. Project proposals with realistic plans on meeting this priority will get high marks in the openness score.


## 5. Alignment with Turing 2.0
_Prioritise activities reflecting Turing 2.0 guiding principles_

[Turing 2.0](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2093) represents the next phase of the Institute – delivering on an ambition to be a truly national institute for data science and AI. Achieving this will mean operating differently to how we do now and having a clearer focus to guide the work we undertake, across science and innovation, skills and engagement. In consultation with the Board of Trustees and Institute’s Research Leadership and Turing Management team, a set of initial [guiding principles](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=Turing+2.0+principles+and+future+activities+March+2022.pdf&fileguid=a8f5af29-20fd-4d25-bdbc-3fa42e561fc9) that will shape Turing 2.0 have been formulated."

*Note: The Institute wide salary bands don't distinguish between 3a and 3b. This is purely a REG distinction.

**New starter offers:** When making offers to prospective new team members, we make fixed, non-negotiable offers at one of the three fixed baseline points within the overall salary band for the role (i.e. the 0/3, 1/3, 2/3 points). When determining these offers, we consider candidates’ previous experience and consider who their closest future peers are within the existing team. Deciding which of these points represents a fair starting salary for a future colleague based on two hours of interviews can sometimes be challenging but we work very hard to be as confident as we can be that we are not being unfair to either current or future team members and, when the decision is not straightforward, we consult widely with those who interviewed the candidate to ensure we have the best possible input to make the best decision we can.

**Promotion:** On promotion, people will be appointed at the bottom of the salary range for the role.

### 2021-2022 Institute-wide HERA Bands
Effective: 01 April 2021 - 31 March 2022; Cost of living award from previous year: 1.5%

**Note:** In 2021-22 REG salaries were only partially aligned with the HERA bands below.
Junior and Standard were fully aligned but we did not yet have the Band 5 Lead role defined and Principals had not yet been formally mapped into Band 6.
Senior salaries spanned all of Band 4 and some of Band 5 due to the effect of cost of living increases from previous years on salaries within the previous REG-specific Senior salary band of £45,0000 - £60,000 (which had not had its minimum and maximum salaries adjusted in line with the cost of living increases applied to individual salaries).

| Role      | Band | Role Salary Min | Role Salary Max | Bottom third baseline | Middle third baseline | Top third baseline |
|-----------|:----:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| Principal | 6    | £66,000         | £75,500         | £66,000               | £69,167               | £72,333            |
| Lead      | 5    | £56,000         | £65,500         | £56,000               | £59,167               | £62,333            |

"
REG-line-management.md,"Line management in REG is a little different than in other parts of the Turing as you often will not be working directly with the people you are managing. This guide aims to explain how this relationship might work.

## How line management duties are assigned

At (current) senior level, people are expected to line manage 1-2 standards. This will probably change with the new lead role (see the [REG role matrix](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/development/REG-Roles-Matrix.md#line-managementmentoring)). Currently, if seniors are willing to line manage more than 2 people, they should inform the recruitment lead (currently Pam).

At standard level, opportunities for line management and project mentoring of junior members and interns are offered during the year. To assign such duties, we follow whenever possible time spent at standard level in REG.

At both levels, we try to avoid overlaps between projects and line management, at least during probation.

## First day

As a line manager you will have a 1-to-1 meeting with the person you will be managing on their first day. By this point they will have had various other inductions (eg. with HR, IT, their REG buddies). You might want to focus on the following points

- introduce what line management is at REG
    - part mentor, part escalation point, part pastoral support, part admin, can take different shapes depending on need
- ... and what it is isn’t
    - task-setting, boss vibes, oversight
- point out that line management, like everything else in REG, is a collaboration
    - have a chat about what management styles have worked well for them.
- find out their background, why they decided to join the group
- discuss what their day-to-day might look like
    - 80% projects (either one or two projects)
    - 10% REG responsibilities (eg. service areas)
    - 10% personal development
- briefly talk about how people are allocated to projects
- check that they've taken a look at the [new starters checklist](New-starter-checklist)
- leave time for questions

## First week

Later in the first week you might want to go through some of the more technical points:

- [Team reporting structure](Team-reporting-structure)
- Adding yourself to the [Turing GitHub organisation](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=3844fabf8b1c45ca9028758a350ff230)
- Emoji reacting to projects
    - Projects [looking for people](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2#column-2488036)
    - [Currently active](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2#column-1062281) projects
- Project allocations on [Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/974183/schedule/team)
- Personal time tracking on [Harvest](https://thealanturinginstitute.harvestapp.com/time/week) (noting that this is not compulsory)
- Probation formalities"

Organising-events.md,"_This guide was put together after organising several workshop/teaching events.
Generally the Events team and others in the Business team will be able to help with managing events, but the notes below may be useful if you ever end up self-organising an event.
If you have a different experience, please edit!_

## Booking Enigma

Enigma fills up early, especially if you need more than one day for your event.
As a general guide, look at least two months ahead if you want a reasonable amount of choice.

- Look at the Turing Calendar\* and find a good time.
  Those marked ""Events hold"" _may_ be free, but you'll need to check with Events.
- You can book Enigma either via Reception or Events.
For smaller meeting rooms, book through a calendar invitation or Reception.
  - Reception: Fine for small events, but remember that you won't get as much support with the organisation.
  - Events team: Booking via the Events team is a longer process - you will need to fill in a five-page [Event Application Form](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/search?q=KI%200531) and send it to the Events team.
  They will get in touch within a few days to discuss dates and other arrangements.
  You'll also get support for registration, website etc. if needed.
- If you are arranging a large event, you might need to book another room (usually Lovelace) for catering.

\*In Outlook, go to `Organize`, then click `Open Shared Calendar` and search for ""Turing Calendar"".
Note that this calendar also includes events held elsewhere, but there isn't a way to see a separate list for Enigma only.
You can also add the calendars of the other meeting rooms in the same way.

## Event times

Starting after 9:30am
- The main entrance to the British Library opens at 9:30am.
- Once inside, attendees can get their visitor's pass from Reception.
- You should provide a list of attendees to Reception a couple of days in advance of the event.
- Make sure to inform attendees that
  - There is often a queue to enter the British Library.
  - Bags larger than airline carry-on size are not permitted in the library.

Starting before 9:30am
- Attendees will need to use the staff entrance.
- You should provide a list of names to Reception and make sure the list also gets sent to the staff downstairs.
- Someone will need to bring the attendees from the staff entrance up to the Turing.
  This can be inconvenient, so starting the event later is generally preferable.

Ending after 5:30pm
- Talk to the Events team if attendees will be in the Institute later than 5:30pm. Approved members of staff will need to be present if non-Turing attendees are in the office after this time.

## Catering

- Catering should be ordered at least **two weeks** before the event.
  Reception can send you an order form, or you can book via [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=2e1700436eca4c9c94c48f6bb867ef28&openedFromService=true).
- You can make small changes to the order (for dietary requirements etc.) up to a couple of days before the event.
- Menus and prices can be found on [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=72414dd01d6246b2a18d0fa5bb58e4c3&from=ad1b4d94-81d7-4ce3-b8d0-fd5552de1b8b).
- To pay for catering, you will need to supply a nominal code and a project code.
  If you are using funding from an external source, talk to Reception about setting up a purchase order (the Turing will make the payment and then reclaim from the other funding source).
- Make sure to ask about dietary requirements on the registration form.

## Publicity

- The Events team can create websites for events.
- The Turing Bulletin is sent out every Thursday afternoon.
  Email `communications@turing.ac.uk` before the end of Wednesday to have your event included (<100 words).
- Slack: `#events`, `#interesting-events` etc.
- Twitter: `@turinghut23`

## Room setup for workshops

Capacity guides for theatre, boardroom and other styles can be found in the [meeting request form](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=e27b71da716e4292948072e7fdfccd22&from=1dd2ca46-25c4-4dec-b364-ea27232ad5de&openedFromService=true).
If you hold a workshop with a different setup, please add it below so that others can use it as a guide for capacity in future.

### General notes

- If you need a microphone, get in touch with Dan (`dwhitfield@turing.ac.uk`) well in advance of the event.
- You can find spare extension cables in a box on the shelves behind the door of Enigma.
- There might not be enough tables for workshops in Enigma - make sure to check with Reception if you need more than eight.

### Enigma

#### 40 people around five large tables (Spark workshop)
- Eight people per table (made up of two smaller tables).
- Some chairs didn't have a good view of screens.
- Plenty of room for helpers to walk around.
- Extension cables got to three tables easily.
- Microphone was definitely needed.
- Not enough tables; had to borrow from Lovelace.
  We needed two tables to make up the final work table, and two more for catering (tea and snacks only; more tables would be needed for full catering).

#### 35 people around 8 small tables (RSE with Python course)
- 4 or 5 people per table.
- Fairly crowded for helpers to walk around, but small tables were good for group work.
- Tables borrowed from Lovelace.

### Lovelace Suite (3 rooms)

#### ~18 around three tables (Binder workshop)
- Catering on tables at the back of Lovelace.
- Microphone would have been useful - hard to hear from back of the room.
- This was an unusual setup so Reception needed help moving tables and chairs.

## To add

- Registration.
  I (Louise) haven't managed the registration process for any events yet.
  I'd recommend asking someone from the Events team, who may be able to manage the process for you or show you how they use Eventbrite.
"
TopDesk-requests.md,"You should know whether you are part of a team that answers topdesk tickets - if you receive one it should be for a good reason.

If you receive an email to deal with a TopDesk request (e.g. `The following C1234-567 has been assigned to you and requires your
 action.`) follow these steps:

## Types of requests

1. Adding Turing people to the Github organisation: this is the most common request and one for
   whoever is part of the Researcher Tool Management Service Role.

2. Requests clearly not for REG: see whether you can find details on Turing Complete. For example, we received a ticket with the ethics approval for a project, detailed in [this TuringComplete page](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=cb5e35246f474d1f90abae8ea262338c), which lists the Ethics Advisory Group as contact point. If there is an existing appropriate
group / team within TopDesk then please allocate to the group rather than a specific individual.

## Steps to follow

1. Click the link on the email. Alternatively, go to `turingcomplete.topdesk.com`,
login as Operator, and search for the ticket number, e.g. C1901-128 in the top left.

[[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/docs/images/TopDesk%20-%201%20-%20search%20for%20ticket.png|alt=Search for ticket]]

2. Near the bottom left under `Processing`, the Operator Group should already be
REG, which is why it came to us.  Change the Operator according to the type of request.

[[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/docs/images/TopDesk%20-%202%20-%20operator.png|alt=Operator]]

3. You can then type a quick message to the caller in the text box at the right, or check the
box `Make invisible to caller` on top of it.

[[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/docs/images/TopDesk%20-%203%20-%20message.png|alt=Message to caller]]

4. Click `Save` at the top right. An email draft appears.

[[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/docs/images/TopDesk%20-%204%20-%20save.png|alt=Save change]]

5. Change the email recipient at the top left to the operator's email when assigning to a specific individual to avoid another email going to all of REG.

[[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/docs/images/TopDesk%20-%205%20-%20change%20recipient.png|alt=Change recipient]]

6. Click `Send` at the top right.

"
Reclaiming-out-of-pocket-expenses.md,"# Turing's Expense system

Out-of-pocket expenses should be reclaimed using Certify. You should submit an expense claim on Certify for expenses incurred within a given month as soon as possible after that month ends, and no later than 60 days after the expense is incurred (except for visa costs, which can be claimed up to a year after starting employment)

In the first instance, look at the information provided by the Finance team about how to use Certify on Mathison:

https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2169

(This also includes links to Certify's own user guides and videos)

Below is some information which is not covered by the Mathison page.

## How to deal with Receipts from YourTrip/Gray Dawes

Occasionally, receipts from bookings with YourTrip/Gray Dawes are automatically added to your Certify wallet, despite there being no out-of-pocket expenditure. (There are two ways to deal with this situation (we are waiting from guidance from Finance as to which one they would prefer us to do):

### Option 1 - submit it as a non-reimbursable expense

NOTE: @DavidBeavan was asked to clarify if option 2 was acceptable. As of 2022-09-15 no response from Finance.

In Certify, it is possible to edit an expense whilst it is still in your Wallet, to signify that an expense has already been paid for by the Turing, as shown below. Submit the expense as normal, meaning that there is a complete report of to the total expenditure for a particular activity, irrespective of how it was paid for:

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5346065/190383915-ebc4d0db-f706-44be-891a-1023de73ecef.png"" alt=""Screenshot highlighting the 'Reimbursable' expense toggle"" width=""400""/>

### Option 2 Delete it from your wallet

The YourTrip/Gray Dawes booking system should ensure that it will be accounted for from the correct project budget.

Either way, be careful to ensure that you do not inadvertently claim for it as an out-of-pocket expense!

## How to add receipts to your Certify Wallet from a personal phone without the Certify App or Turing Email

Normally receipts (pdfs, screenshots, photos etc) can be sent as attachments from your @turing.ac.uk email address to `receipts@certify.com`. These will be automatically added to your Certify Wallet.

If you do not have (or want) your @turing.ac.uk email configured on your personal phone, and do not what to use the Certify App, there is a third option:

In the web interface, go to Account Settings. There it is possible to add a personal email address to your account (e.g. one you do have on your phone). Any attachments sent from that personal email address will also be added to your Certify Wallet).

## REG-specific budget information

### Check your ""Default Project"" is correct

In the web interface, go to Account Settings. Under the ""User Information"" heading, you should see your, Department, University and Default Project. For REG team members, this should look like:

| Department | Research & Software Engineering (RES-2130) |
| --- | --- |
| University | Turing (TUR) |
| Default Project | Research and Software Engineering (R-RSE-001) |


### Allocating your expenses to the right budget

* If one of your projects is paying for a conference, travel etc; In the ""Add / Edit Expense"" section, you should select “Yes” to “Turing Programme Project Expense?” and then search for the project (see screenshot). Your Expense Report will be sent to the appropriate PMU Programme Manager for approval.

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5346065/190386441-418561cf-320d-4b22-819c-3ff7b05fd971.png"" alt=""Screenshot of an expense allocated to a specific budget"" width=""400""/>

* If your expense is not directly related to a project; In the ""Add / Edit Expense"" section, you should select “No” to “Turing Programme Project Expense?” and leave the ""Project Name Lookup"" blank (see screenshot). Your Expense Report will be sent to the REG Director for approval.

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5346065/190386756-12ee8d65-416e-46be-9e0c-58bd592731b7.png"" alt=""Screenshot of an expense allocated to the default budget"" width=""400""/>


## Visa costs

If you applied for a Skilled Worker visa and were sponsored by the Turing, you are eligible to claim up to £4,000 back (though this is classified as a taxable benefit).
This has to be claimed within one year of starting your employment at the Turing.
See the [Relocation and Visa Allowance Policy on Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2270) for more information.

To do this, you will need the proof of payment sent by UKVI for both the visa application as well as the Immigration Health Surcharge payment.
As of 2023, these cost approximately £1,500 and £600/year respectively, so for a five-year visa the IHS bill should come to (somewhere around £3,000).

 - Save both emails as a PDF and add them to Certify as per the usual guidance.
 - Under 'Category', select 'Relocation Costs'.
 - Under 'Turing Programme', select 'Yes'. In the lookup field, type 'U-HRD-001' and select the one from the dropdown.
 - You can submit a claim that is larger than £4,000; the approver (Martin O) can 'limit' your compensation to £4,000.
   Alternatively, it should be possible to split an expense in Certify and to submit it as part reimbursable and part non-reimbursable.
   If in doubt about anything, it's a good idea to check with Martin.

Annual-pay-increases.md,"Annual pay increases at the Turing have two components.

## Cost of living award
On 01 April each year, an unconditional, universal, **cost of living** increase is made. All staff receive this award, regardless of probation status or performance. This increase also moves the top and bottom of each pay band up by the cost of living percentage.

### Historic cost of living awards and comparison with UK official inflation statistics
For reference the cost of living increases for previous years are listed below, along with the two most recent month's CPIH figures that would have been available to the Remuneration Committee of the board of trustees when setting the CoL increase (that January's and the previous December's as there is a delay of a month or few in publishing each month's CPIH figures).

| Year | Turing Apr CoL increase | Jan CPIH | Prev. Dec CPIH | Cumulative CoL | Cumulative Jan CPIH | Notes |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 2023 | 5.0% | [8.8%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/january2023) | [9.2%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/december2022) | 20.74% | 22.56% | This is the first year the annual CoL increase has not matched or exceeded CPIH. [Mathison post from Jon Atkins](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2833) |
| 2022 | 5.0% | [4.9%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/january2022) | [4.8%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/december2021) | 14.99% | 12.65% | Additional £1,000 one-off cost of living support payment made to all staff in bands 1-3 to help offset the disproportionate effect of inflation on those on lower salaries. |

## Progression award
On 01 July each year, progression awards are made in addition to the cost of living award made each April. These progression awards depend on the outcome of the annual appraisal process, which takes place in May/June of each year.  See [[Annual appraisals]] for more details of this process.

### Principles
1. REG folk who are operating at an equivalent level should receive equivalent pay.
2. We are a learning team and our default assumption is that people will generally be growing and developing in their role as they gain more experience.
3. Everyone who is performing and developing as expected for their role and their experience level within it should expect to progress through their pay band each year on top of the cost of living adjustment. This is very much in line with the guidance on salary increases from HR (see below).

### Mechanism
- All team members who have been performing and developing as expected for their experience level will receive the same ""small"" progression increase in pay each year above the cost of living increase. The actual percentage increase this corresponds to is set by HR each year but the expectation is that, if performing and developing as expected each year, you would progress from the bottom to the top of your band in around 6-8 years. This is in line with the expected progression rate in the university spine point system.
- Exceptionally, where someone has progressed significantly more than what would reasonably be expected, a further adjustment may be made to ensure that Principle 1 still holds.
- Where someone has been promoted within the year, they will already have received their progression pay increase for the year at promotion and no further progression increase will be awarded at appraisal time.
- In the rare cases someone in the team is not performing or developing as expected, no progression increase will be awarded. This situation should be managed via ongoing support throughout the year. In general, this should not be a surprise at appraisal time.
- Team members who are at the top of their pay band are not eligible for a progression pay rise, but they are eligible for a bonus if consistently performing at a high level.

### Historic progression pay awards in REG

| Year | Standard award | CoL + Std. award* | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| 2023 | TBC | TBC | |
| 2022 | 3.0% | 8.44% | |
| 2021 | 2.0% | 3.53% | |

_*Cost of Living and Progression Award increases are compounded rather than added._

Project-tracking.md,"# Tracking projects and other tasks

We use GitHub extensively for tracking projects and other tasks within the team.

## Hut23 Repo

The [Hut23 repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23) is the central hub for most team matters and admin.

- [Project Tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2): Board showing all upcoming, current and completed projects. There's an issue for each project (see below).
- [Issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues): Each project has an issue following a common template, including a general description of a project and its current status, for example. There are also issues for service areas and other activities/organisational issues for the team.
- This Wiki contains generally helpful info about all things REG. This includes [[Team outputs]].

Managing-the-project-process.md,"## Guides on managing projects

### Agreeing to do projects

- New projects to be presented for consideration at our montly Project Allocation Meetings should be summarised using this online form:

  https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=p_SVQ1XklU-Knx-672OE-RiWBPnBiXFGqyWz4kLTXdFUQ0ZaWkdITlRSSUxMRkdQRkZZSVdIWVJBTSQlQCN0PWcu

### Finding people for projects

1. If you are a Programme Lead: please keep track of which new projects are coming up in the next 6 months, and ensure there is a Senior REG person assigned to these. To do so, badger the “staffing coordinator” (currently James G at 10 November 2021).

2. Project Leads (that is, the most senior REG person on the project): please ensure that your project is resourced. This means ensuring that there are people to start. It also means checking the total “budget” for the project and making sure we will meet it. To do so, badger the staffing coordinator.

Note that (2) is not entirely straightforward because projects are no longer staffed in integer multiples of 0.5 people for a fixed number of months. Sometimes we allocated, say, 0.8 people for a while, which means that either the project run-rate will need to increase or the project duration extended.

### Problems and issues

Occasionally, issues arise on projects which require escalation. If this happens to you, and you are the most senior REG person on the project, please get in touch with the REG Programme Lead for the Programme relating to the project. (That person will be at least Senior.)

If the issue cannot be resolved at that level (which does happen from time to time!) then please escalate to the Principal who is the line manager of the Programme lead. See the end of this email for the current Programme Leads and their line managers.

# Other

A non-exhaustive list of published (or pre-published) outputs or public activities given by the team in reverse chronological order.

Types of output can be:
* Code
* Data
* Monograph
* Article (academic or otherwise)
* Preprint
* Public engagement
* Impact
* Radio broadcast
* Podcast
* Report
* [[Team Workshops]]
* [[Team talks]]
* [[Team community involvement]]

Public links to outputs can be shared widely outside the team.
If you are comfortable with your output being shared (and you should be for published works), then please add a public link to the output. If a public link does not already exist, please consider uploading your output to a public archive platform such as [figshare](https://figshare.com/), [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Academic outputs should, if they are to be counted in the [REF](https://www.ref.ac.uk/), be in an institutional repository (the Turing currently does not have one).

If you are not happy for your output to be publicly shared, then please consider sharing them within the team by placing a copy of your slides in the team OneDrive/SharePoint and sharing a link to the output as a private link below (right click the folder in OnDrive, select ""Share"" and then select the ""People with existing access"" option).

TODO: This table is not really adequate, and a proper repository and citations list is really needed by the Turing. We could do much better with a shared Zotero group to be honest.

Probation-Review.md,"# Probation information for new joiners and managers

During the initial 6 months in a team member's appointment to the institute, they will undergo probation review with their line manager. (Note that if an existing team member was previously in another role at the Turing and underwent probation review in that role, they do not require a probation review when appointed to a role in REG.) This is designed to integrate with the on-boarding process to ensure that new team members are performing their job as expected. This wiki page outlines the expectations for team members and line managers in going through the probation process.

Turing-wide information on probation can be found on Mathison:

- [Probation Policy](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=Probation+Policy+HRPOL017+V1.0.pdf&fileguid=070ff12d-845c-400d-9826-bac27fa5b3ad)

## Information for team members on probation

Probation in REG is a lightweight review process that will ensure you are settling into the role and performing as expected. Turing policy is that such reviews should occur with meetings at 3 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months from the team member's start date, with a final recommendation at 6 months:

- **3 weeks:** Create a set of initial probation objectives once the team member has settled in. Note that you might not have a clear project or projects to work on at this point, so it is fine to refine any objectives set now at the subsequent reviews. Your manager can help you set appropriate objectives.
- **3 months:** Initial review of progress towards your probation objectives. Your line manager will solicit feedback from people you have worked with to ensure you are settling into the team. You may need to revise your objectives to adjust for changes in the projects you have been working on, which is very normal.
- **5 months:** Final review prior to end of probation. The timing of this review is designed to give one last chance for actionable feedback to someone that is underperforming. In cases where someone is underperforming the most likely action to be taken at this time is to extend probation for an additional 3 months.
- **6 months:** Recommendation is made to pass probation, or to extend if the team member would benefit from additional time to settle into the role.

Upon passing probation, the REG Leadership Team (Director and the Principals) will review your salary to ensure you are fairly placed relative to your peers. See the wiki page on [[Annual-pay-increases]] for more information on the REG philosophy and principles for pay and progression, and additional information specific to the end of probation review below.

## Probation information for line managers

As a manager, you are expected to help guide your report through their initial project work (or other team activities if they are not assigned to a project) and ensure their probation objectives are appropriate for their role. You should be gathering regular feedback from the team member's collaborators (ideally someone more senior than them) and passing on information on their work and giving any constructive feedback. If all is going well, a quick message to the reviewers every few weeks to confirm that all is okay should be fine, and you should pass this information on in your regular 1/1s with the team member.

At 3 months, you will hold a mid-term probation review, which should simply be a slightly more formal version of the ongoing feedback on their performance. If the team member did not have a project initially, then this is a good opportunity to revisit the initial objectives and ensure they reflect the work expected of the team member. This is also a good opportunity to ensure they are participating in team events like Tech Talks, integrating socially with the team (particularly if they are not regularly working in the office), and are contributing to a Service Area.

At 5 months, you will hold a second review. This review is mostly to ensure that any performance issues are communicated well in advance of the 6 month deadline (see below), but should be similar to the 3 month review.

If you do hear any concerns about the team member's performance, it is *very* important to follow up on this promptly. Because REG is a learning team, people are frequently working in unfamiliar territory and it can be difficult to recognize that they can ask for help when they are struggling and it is not a reflection on their performance. The team member could also be facing a difficult situation outside of work -- if they are not comfortable sharing their situation with you, then refer them to Debbie Dixon, the Turing's External Supervisor. If there are problems with the team member's performance and the manager is not comfortable giving this feedback to the team member, then it is best to ask for help from the Principal into whom you report. If there are still problems with the team member's performance at the 5 month review, then you should speak to the Principal in your reporting line.

## Salary review

At the end of probation, REG will conduct a salary review of the team member passing probation. REG has two ways in which salary changes are made: within band changes, and annual progression awards. More information on these types of salary changes can be found on the [[Annual-pay-increases]] wiki page.

A within-band change is to adjust the team member's placement in the band to correct a significant misalignment -- REG makes non-negotiable offers at one of three places in the salary band when hiring new team members, and thus we use the end of probation as the first opportunity to make any corrections we feel are needed to move a team member to a different third of the band. If the manager feels someone is not correctly placed at the end of probation, this recommendation is passed to the REG Leadership team for a decision (the final decision on all salary matters lies with the REG Director, subject to approval by Institute Senior Management).

A manager can assess the placement of their report by determining their report's salary (which is available on Cezanne under ""My Team > [Team Member] > Personal & Work Details > Compensation Summary"") and comparing to the [[Salary-bands-for-all-REG-Roles]] page. Note that this is inherently a difficult task, as you do not know the placement of the person's peers in the band, so this is considered a recommendation and will be cross-checked by the REG Director (who does have all salary information for the team) for the final decision.

A progression raise is meant to acknowledge the usual development and progression of a team member, and is granted automatically to all team members that are performing well (team members completing probation are considered to be performing well). These awards are given as part of the PRP process, but if the team member is scheduled to end probation after the PRP deadline in December each year, then the team member will not be eligible. Thus, to prevent small differences in start dates from affecting pay rises, the REG Director will recommend an equivalent salary increase at the end of probation to correct for this. This only affects people completing probation between the start of January and the end of June, and the increase will be pro-rated for the amount of service time (i.e. someone ending probation in January will get the equivalent to half of the ""usual"" progression raise, while someone ending probation at the end of June will get no progression raise, as their raise will be applied in the next PRP round).

Line managers should complete the [probation completion form](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/tree/master/development/probation-completion-form.md) and send to the Principal in their reporting line."

Equipment.md,"## Getting a New Computer


This is a list of the steps I, James G, took when I got a new laptop from IT.

- [ ] Sign in to Apple Cloud on new machine. Activate all accounts (Office365, personal email, ...)

- [ ] `brew cask install emacs`, and anything else you need.

- [ ] In my case, I store config files on Apple Cloud, and symbolic link them to their required place, eg:
  * `~/.emacs.el`
  * `~/.bash_profile`

- [ ] Office (including OneDrive): I installed with the new ""self service"" app that IT now bundle with laptops (which apparently installs things via homebrew!)

- [ ] OneDrive setup. I have a personal shared space on OneDrive, but also multiple shared spaces for projects, set up as ""Groups"" in Office 365. The standard location that Office chooses for your local OneDrive image is annoyingly long and full of spaces. So I put all shared spaces in ~/OneDrive-Actuals and then symbolic link to ~/OneDrive (for my personal space) and ~/Share/X (for project X).

- [ ] SSH tokens for GitHub. I made new ones. I had thought about moving them, but it turned out to be straightforward to make new ones.

- [ ] Go through every repo with an authoritative remote, make sure I've pushed all local commits, and delete. (I keep all repos in `~/Projects/`, with remotes usually on GitHub.)

- [ ] Double-check other directories within `~/`

- [ ] Install Emacs additions as I learn that I need them ...


## Home Equipment"
Open-Access-Journal-Articles.md,"The Turing has access to a block grant to cover open access charges for journal publications if there are not already funds in the project-specific grant to cover them. If you have published an article, you may be able to cover the open access fees using this funding source -- [there is a form on Turing Complete to apply for this funding](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=743bfbfbfa7a49528b0f23c1503270b9), along with information about the criteria for obtaining funding from this source. Review of this form is done by the PMU, so please direct questions to Catherine Lawrence or the appropriate PMU contact for the programme associated with your project."
REG-specific-Finance-codes.md,"This page is to document the ""Finance codes"" that are used in Turing's Finance system to specify the source of funding for a cost.

- `R-RSE-001`: The standard REG code, to which everyone is initially charged, before being recharged to a project or other activity.
- `R-RSE-002`: REG core activity, including service areas and REG internal projects.
- `R-RSE-003`: Dedicated management and operations.
- `R-RSE-004`: RCP

"
Equipment-Queries.md,"### Standard Equipment

- You should have received a MacBook Pro either before or on your first day, contact your line manager urgently if this hasn't happened.
    - Once your IT credentials are set up (see point 2) In addition to the standard MacBook Pro you can request peripherals such as a monitor, keyboard and mouse [here](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=eee3b659bb3e4ab5aaed67f807ebd8c3&openedFromService=true).

### Additional Equipment

 -- what there is and what you would like?


- If there are health and safety reasons why you would want equipment that differs from the Apple keyboard/mouse then contact HR directly, there is a separate health and safety budget for such things.

### Office Furniture

- The Turing also offers furniture for home working such as a desk or a chair. At the time of writing (Dec 2021) the budget per person is £150 for a chair and £150 for a desk. You can pick your own, the usual routes are through Amazon or [Office Furniture Online](https://www.officefurnitureonline.co.uk/). Anything more than £150 and they will have to purchase themselves then claim back up to £150 via certify. The official process is to assess your home-working set up via a [workstation self-assessment](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=6100f533868f4165bcadd1b5f2050a08) form, but you can also just email facilities (facilities@turing.ac.uk) and be nice."

REG-student-drop-in-sessions.md,"# REG student drop-in sessions

## Summary

- **What?**: Research software & data science technical drop-in sessions for students based at the Turing
- **When?**: every Tuesday from 13:30-14:30
- **Where?**: on Zoom: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/606996571?pwd=haUeR9-Ypwoy_-fxjvz1ySo_eocgsw
- **Who?**: Drop-in sessions are hosted by members of the Turing Research Engineering Group. Regular hosts are:
  - [Tim](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/timothy-hobson)
  - [Fede](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/federico-nanni)

## More details

Turing's Research Engineering Group aims to provide regular, informal, community-led sessions where students & researchers can come along to ask questions about technical problems or challenges, or to ask for general technical advice. The sessions offer a friendly and welcoming, non-judgemental environment where you can ask for technical advice or assistance without concern about being judged on your level of technical knowledge, expertise or understanding.

As our organisers and helpers know, many of us working with software in the research community have been trained in domains where computing has not traditionally been a key element. There can be lots to learn in terms of new jargon and technical skills and we all have to start somewhere.

We can help with:

- **General programming problems** including helping to identify and fix bugs.
- **Cloud computing questions** including how to get started on Azure.
- **Software sustainability:** best practices for testing, managing and packaging your code.
- **Reproducible research:** advice on ensuring that your software is developed in a manner that supports long-term reproducibility of research outputs, including techniques for packaging and archiving code.
- **High Performance Computing (HPC) support and advice:** we can offer support and advice on the HPC resources available at the Turing.

## Joining sessions

Our weekly sessions run for one hour from 13:30-14:30 every Tuesday and are hosted on Zoom and in person (details at the top of the page). Everyone is welcome to drop-in at any time. There's no need to register in advance."
Booking-Rooms.md,"# Booking a Room.

There are instructions on how to book a room on [Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2118&SearchId=175781&utm_source=interact&utm_medium=quick_search&utm_term=meeting+rooms). The `Room Finder` tool mentioned there doesn't work for me.

The simplest way of finding a room is to use the `Scheduling Assistant` on a meeting invite.

Then scroll down to `Add Location`. This will give you a list of Available Rooms for your specific time. It will update when you move the time window.

## List of REG members and topics they are happy to be contacted about

We all have different overlapping skills but we don't do that well at learning from one another.

It is more fun and fulfilling to learn together rather than plough along in isolation. This page is a catalogue of members who would be happy to be grabbed for a chat on any of the listed topics.

Please, reach out on slack to anyone in the table if you're struggling with something, and perhaps even add yourself!

(if you want a wider net, you can post on #askaway, or #hut23).

Team-reporting-structure.md,"## Upcoming new starters

We should avoid new starters being line managed by either of the REG leads on their first projects. This ensures they have an independent person to discuss any challenges / issues with their projects and, in these remote working times, also increases the number of team members they work together with on a regular basis.

_Status:_ this document is a draft proposal.

## RSE projects

*   There should be a Github issue for each thing we do. It’s ok for issues to
    evolve and my preference would be that the top description box always has
    the most up to date, clearest description of the issue and its definition of
    done. Feel free to make liberal use of the comments for communication and
    tracking investigative / exploratory work. The main description box should
    contain a clear definition of done / acceptance criteria sufficient for the
    following to be done in principle by different people from the team who are
    involved in the project.
    *   Implement the functionality
    *   Write tests to validate the implementation meets the definition of done
    *   Review the implementation for correctness

*   All code should have automated tests, with all tests runnable by a single
    command by someone who has checked out a fresh copy of the repo.

*   All dependencies, installation, compilation etc should be scripted such that
    these can be triggered by a single command by someone who has checked out a
    fresh copy of the repo. Dependencies required only for testing can require a
    second command or few.

*   Each new issue should be developed on a short-lived feature branch split
    from “master”. These branches ideally only live around 0.5-2 days before
    being merged back into master. Merge process should be: merge master into
    feature branch and resolve any conflicts. Push latest feature branch to
    Github. Open PR to merge into master after review + continuous integration
    (CI) tests.

*   Code should be committed regularly in small chunks. You should generally be
    committing multiple times per day. Commits on feature branches can have
    broken functionality or tests, but all merges into master should only occur
    at commits where the code is correct and has passing tests.

*   All code commits should be accompanied by tests verifying it behaves as
    expected. At a minimum code submitted as a PR should have tests that show it
    meets the definition of done defined in the related issue(s). However, code
    should have additional unit / regression / integration tests where
    appropriate (it’s almost always appropriate). Writing code then tests is a
    significantly lower quality assurance measure than writing tests first / in
    iteration with the code, so you should do the latter.

*   All code should have had two eyeballs on it before it is merged into master,
    either through pair programming or code review within the PR. Please note on
    the PR who two eyes were. The second pair of eyes can be anyone on the
    project (not just a coder), anyone in our team or someone from a related
    team (e.g. the UCL research programming). Whether as pair programming or a
    code review, the final PR code should be validated against the definition of
    done detailed in the related issue(s) by the two pairs of eyes.

*   The Github repository should be set up to run all tests on all pushes to all
    branches and on all PRs. Currently this can be done for public repos via
    Travis CI and Appveyor. If CI is set up this way, commits to master should
    be blocked unless all tests pass.

Project-start-up-guidance.md,"# Project start up guidance

@fedenanni and @DavidBeavan have been leading some thinking on project-startup, and some best practices and checklists to consider when getting a new project with a new partner successfully going. Do join in

TODOs
- [ ] Schedule another co-working session
- [ ] Integrate with Turing Way - a new chapter?
- [ ] All: iterate and improve

Below captured from: https://hackmd.io/3dA_RWneT2WbMaSnRO_kDA

# REG on a new project: a check-list

## Welcome to the Tech Talk
* Intro
* Goals - Turing Way chapter?
* 5mins (ish) on each heading below
* Join us in the discussion
* Help us with notes

## :arrow_right: Want to join us for more and write up, scroll to bottom and put your name down plz :arrow_left:

## Promo

Your brains :brain: needed. Join @fedenanni and me on :calendar: Tuesday at 12.30 for a REG Tech Talk on project start-up essentials :rocket: and how to get going with new collaborators :linked_paperclips: . Would make a lovely Turing Way chapter :book:  https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/356411961?pwd=Tjloa2t0OHFzUGVaNG9xRmxxSGVxZz09

## Expectations

Communicate expectations e.g. does know the start/end/REG effort?

Communicate that we're often on multiple projects and how that affects work and time.

Are there particlar days REG is on or off the project?

""setting up the setting of expectations"" from REG leadership as well?
  - ""Someone will be starting to work on your project soon. They will set some expectations that might look like X. This is because they work on more than one project. For example, one week for your dedicated team is something like 2 days for a 0.5FTE REG member.""
  - Nipping behaviour in the bud is more desirable over explicit(repeated?) pushback
  - none of this should be a surprise to the PI, if it is, how can we make sure they have these expectations from an earlier stage (PMU? scoping?)

Should we remind projects that if we are 0.5FTE this corresponds to 2 days a week?

Code of conduct / contributor guidelines / ways of working

What are the immediate pressures and risks on the project?

This is often a learning experience for REG too

For projects which don't have an immediate product or vision, working together on a backbrief is a usful initial exercise.

Time commitment and risk / pressures could have happened before in the project scoping

## Meeting routine

Decide early on the type of meeting routine and if no one is leading on this, maybe take it under your wing. In LongNLP the PI is handling many other meetings and projects at the same time so she was happy to delegate the organisation of standup meetings etc to us.

I would suggest weekly standups with a quick overview of the project board and once a month a longer meeting with proper longterm planning (this is the Safe Haven project approach). Then of course in between specific calls but not recurring meetings.

Are meetings better over asynchronous working?

Could meeting schedule support 1 week on, one week off REG working, if desired?

Weekly meeting a la Safe Haven, with round-table discussion and making sure all issues are visitied and updated.

Does it work well having one planning meeting (project board, scrum style) and then other ~~meetings~~ co-working sessions to do the creative work, but with limited membership to those who are stakeholders or responsible for the doings.

## Agile working

Does everone know agile working practices? How to encourage project-wide team to use

In Living with Machines we have two different types of project boards. The first type is for having overviews of broad tasks in the whole project, and we use them also for keeping meeting agendas. I am using it for instance [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Living-with-Machines/projects/40), inspired by the [REG EDI](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/6) project board.

The other type of project board is specifically dedicated to a work package (for instance a paper or a tool.) and could be used for weekly standup meeting agenda.

## Informal communication

If all people are already on the Turing Slack that could work quite well. Basically setting up one or more dedicated channels with associated names (lwm-main, lwm-nlp, lwm-reg, lwm-animacy). If the collaborators are external or the project could become a long-running work they might prefer an independent Slack. In that case I would suggest to use it also for handling communications with stakeholders and participants to workshops (in LongNLP we have private channels for members of the projects and public for people interested in the work)

* Asynchronous decision making can be more inclusive. Everyone has a chance to participate, not just those who are on Slack at that time.
* Output of a synchronous (e.g. Slack) conversation needs to be captured somewhere persistant (e.g. GitHub issues) for posterity

- (might not belong here) get feedback from PIs at
    - The end of the project
    - After 4-8weeks to check progress and ways of working are, erm, working

## Reading groups (as a co-learning experience)

Be up-to-date with the literature, share knowledge across disciplines.


## How to keep the project informed of your schedule / other meetings / days off

LwM people have access to my calendar and we have a synced calendar - but this does not work for all projects.

Useful on some projects to have a (rough) timeline from the start, including upcoming holidays etc.


## Code

Other things we could mention:

- branches / code review

Does everyone know how to use git / gitflow / merge


## Data access

Azure storage accounts?

Data Safe Haven?

## Outside the REG box
* Let's get input from PMU/TPS and wider coleagues
* Also from PIs, other REG collaborators and groups
* Other RSE groups too?

*Please note*:

Since this was written the bulk of the hut23 wiki has been moved here, to the research-engineering-group wiki, so that it is visible within the Turing. This page has not yet been updated to reflect this change.

## Where stuff might go

1. The Hut23 wiki
2. The Hut23 repository
    - documents in the repo
    - issues
    - branches
3. The Hut23 shared OneDrive
4. Research Engineering public website
5. Topdesk
6. A wiki or repo on the Alan Turing Institute organisation on GitHub

## Where stuff should go

### General rules

1. Everything that is intended to be shared should be in one of the places above.
    - Eg, Not HackMD. (A HackMD document should be preserved at the end of the collaboration session, and transferred to one of the other places)
    - Not Slack. (Slack should be for informal conversations)
2. Information intended for formal, external consumption (beyond REG) should either be on our public website or on Topdesk. Put in on Topdesk only if it should not be seen by the public.
   - Talk to Evelina re: our website
   - Talk to Tomas re: Topdesk
3. Information on a wiki should be findable by following links starting at the Home page of that wiki. The Home page should be rather like an annotated table of contents.
    - Everyone can edit the wiki and the information should be kept up to date.
4. Information should not go in a repository unless it fits the directory structure. If a new directory structure is required, that needs some thought. The directory structure should be, so far as possible, ""mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive"" (MECE).


#### How to share information with the team
Does it fit into the Hut23 repo directory structure?
- Yes:
    1. Create a new branch
    2. Make a pull request, tag a person from the documentation service area and/or random senior person as a reviewer
    3. The reviewer merges the pull request
- No
    1. Put it in the wiki
    2. Make sure is linked from the first page of the wiki/a related page on the wiki


### Hut23 repo vs. Hut23 wiki

The Hut23 wiki is like a ""handbook"" for Hut23 -- it provides guidance, help, and links to reference sources. It is a **living document**. The Hut23 repo is a repository of documents.

The wiki is the primary way we find information that is not ""operational"" or ""lots of examples of a particular category"". The repo has a ""standardised structure of the repo"".

Examples:
- Things that could be thought of as formal, ""published"" documents: on the repo (linked from the wiki). Eg, job descriptions
- Things that are the effluvia from operational processes: on the repo (directory should be linked from the wiki)

### Hut23 wiki vs. other wiki

Use a GitHub wiki (under Alan Turing Institute) for things you want to share within the Insitute that admit some collaboration by others within the Insitute.
    -eg, The ""Space Working Group"" wiki

Ideally, have a link off the Institute's pinned (notice-board).

### Hut23 repo vs REG OneDrive

- Confidential: OneDrive
- ""Source code"": repo; ""Compiled output"": OneDrive
    - that is to say, if it's ""published"" output then OneDrive, but if it needs collaborative editing until it's published, then Repo
- Operational needs of REG (eg, finance reports, job descriptions, reviews, planning output): OneDrive
    - Basically: if you have finished editing it (forever): OneDrive
- Reference material from elsewhere: OneDrive

REG-budget-and-project-codes.md,"## Project codes
Project codes determine the source of funding that ultimately pays any cost.  They look like `R-XYZ-999` or sometimes `R-XYZ-ABC`.

Project-specific costs should be charged to the individual project code. This will ensure costs are billed to the project budget. You must ensure that the project's PI or programme manager is happy for a particular cost to be charged to a project before doing so.

Costs related to the team rather than a specific project should be charged to project code `R-RSE-001`. This will charge the cost to our team's core budget. This is a limited source of funds and therefore costs should only be charged to this if they cannot be charged to a project.

Project codes should be in the structured information at the top of the corresponding issue on our [Github project board](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2). If it is missing for one of your projects, please refer to the section below, and update the project issue with it.

### How to find (or update) a project code

The primary, trustworthy source of project codes *within REG* is **Forecast**.  All projects on Forecast are listed, along with their project code (where we know what this is), on the [Forecast Project page](https://forecastapp.com/974183/projects).  The project code for a given project will appear as a grey 'tag' underneath the name of that project, with text like `R-XYZ-999`.

When looking up a project code, please:
- Check that the project is really the one that you intended.  Note that a few projects have the same, or similar-sounding names.  The most reliable way to check that you have found the right project is to check the GitHub issue for that project -- pay particular attention to the project's **end date**.
- Does the Forecast project correspond to the correct phase of work?  A few projects had or have multiple funding sources, and therefore multiple phases with different project codes.
- If you are in doubt, please check in the first instance with the REG Challenge Lead for the programme that the project falls under (they are grouped by 'Programme' on the above page).
- If you are charging a project, particularly for large amounts, such as for REG time, is the relevant Programme Manager aware of this?

**Do not edit the project codes yourself**.  If a project code is missing or incorrect, it may be tempting to add or edit it, but please instead **let the relevant Challenge Lead know**, who will get in touch with the PMU colleague who looks after that project.  It is important that both the Challenge Lead and the Programme Manager know about a code being added or changed. The REG Challenge Lead 'owns' the projects under their Programme on Forecast, and the PMU is the ultimate source of this information.

**For challenge leads:** To edit a project code, click on the project in the above list, then you can edit the tags.  The tag should be all uppercase, and consist of just the code (for example, `R-RSE-001` for internally funded projects).

## Budget codes
Budget codes classify the type of the expense. It is important to classify expenses correctly for the
institute's accounts, and different types of expense can be treated differently for tax, so it is
important to pick the right budget code for a particular expense. REG generally use only a subset of
these codes, so please talk to Martin before using one of the non-common codes for the first time. In
general travel, subsistence and accommodation should be handled by the outsourced provider, but there may be cases where this is handled outside of the system (e.g. reimbursing a speaker).

The budget codes are constructed from the REG department code `RES-2130` plus a common expenditure code used across departments. If you are specifically asked for a department code, quote `RES-2130`.

Entirely optional, and only where these accounts are used to discuss work things. It is very likely all these are personal and not Turing approved in any way. (This really wants to be some database, and a super wide table will just suck, so a list it is...)

Project-shut-down-guidance.md,"# Project shut down guidance

Some thoughts on how to shut down and successfully wrap up a project. Do join in editing.

* Use the 'Snark Hunt' process to debrief:
  * [Snark Hunt Guidance](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/strategy-and-planning/snark-hunting.md)
  * [Snark Hunt Template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/strategy-and-planning/snark-hunting-template.md)
* Make sure we put appropriate licences on the code so we can fork/copy it legitimately when the project ends
* Making sure that the main GitHub readme.md file is informative and useful, i.e. has a project description, information on how to install/use the software, contribute, get help
* Making sure that the GitHub repo is clean, i.e. no unnecessary issues, files, etc.
* Review the outputs to ""[Defining Project Doneness](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining-done)"" from the Handbook.
* Giving a talk to showcase the work / writing a blog post
* Submitting a paper, e.g. JOSS"
Moving-to-a-new-computer.md,"This is a list of the steps I, James G, took when I got a new laptop from IT.

- [ ] Sign in to Apple Cloud on new machine. Activate all accounts (Office365, personal email, ...)

- [ ] `brew cask install emacs`, and anything else you need.

- [ ] In my case, I store config files on Apple Cloud, and symbolic link them to their required place, eg:
  * `~/.emacs.el`
  * `~/.bash_profile`

- [ ] Office (including OneDrive): I installed with the new ""self service"" app that IT now bundle with laptops (which apparently installs things via homebrew!)

- [ ] OneDrive setup. I have a personal shared space on OneDrive, but also multiple shared spaces for projects, set up as ""Groups"" in Office 365. The standard location that Office chooses for your local OneDrive image is annoyingly long and full of spaces. So I put all shared spaces in ~/OneDrive-Actuals and then symbolic link to ~/OneDrive (for my personal space) and ~/Share/X (for project X).

- [ ] SSH tokens for GitHub. I made new ones. I had thought about moving them, but it turned out to be straightforward to make new ones.

- [ ] Go through every repo with an authoritative remote, make sure I've pushed all local commits, and delete. (I keep all repos in `~/Projects/`, with remotes usually on GitHub.)

- [ ] Double-check other directories within `~/`

- [ ] Install Emacs additions as I learn that I need them ...

Azure.md,"Azure is Microsoft's cloud service. The Turing has a grant from Microsoft to use this.

## Setting up Azure

You can access Azure through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), using your Office 365 credentials.

To experiment with Azure you should request a trial account with $300 credit using this [TopDesk Link](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=ac51b39d8bfc46f9bf41132ef8601b5e&from=7edfe644-ac0d-4895-af98-acd425ee0b19&openedFromService=true). When using Azure for projects you can use the same form to request a project-specific subscription with its own budget.
