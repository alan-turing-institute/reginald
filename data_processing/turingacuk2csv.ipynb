She had worked as a research scholar in Electrical Engineering Department, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, India. She is currently pursuing her Ph.D. from Durham University, UK. Her research interests include carbon intelligent computing to deal with uncertainties associated with renewable\\xa0energy systems.\\xa0\\nAnkita started her research career in core power systems but looking into the challenges of energy systems she is fascinated to resolve the key challenges using artificial intelligence (AI) and data analysis. Her core power engineering skills and understanding of data analysis and AI will empower her to understand the key challenges related to the uncertainties existing at various levels in the power system and thereafter propose a sustainable solution for renewable-powered energy systems.\\nAnkita as a PhD student can potentially lead to a futuristic research theme centred around carbon intelligent energy systems. Ankita is a strong candidate with unique skills whose possible research fits well with Turing's research vision. Her research contributions are in line with the ongoing research directions in The Alan Turing Institute. Specifically, the top Professors and researchers around the globe are working in similar research directions at various top Universities to achieve a net-zero carbon emission ecosystem.\\xa0\\nShe will be utilizing the research opportunities given to her by the institute to broaden her horizon and orient her research work in the right direction. She along with other bright researchers is willing to collaborate to find novel outcomes in the area of computing and power engineering.\\xa0\\n© The Alan Turing Institute\\n2023.
