# Reginald 24/08/23

## Notes
- Quick overview of existing Reginald Work
    - Reginald (Handbook): fine-tune a Q&A LLM using the REG handbook
    - Reginald (Llama): use something called llama-index
    - Quick recap of the type of questions it answered
- Discussion of work to do this month
    - Mainly focus on model development
    - Getting onto Turing slack would be nice, but important to get the model working well first
        - Not the end of the world with the bot existing in another Slack workspace for now
        - Time better spent to learn about LLMs and playing around with libraries rather than looking into technicalities of slack and IT policy
    - Models to look at
        - RAG
        - Using LLama2 rather than OpenAI API

## Actions
- Start playing around with llama-index again and read up on alternative models
- Look into using an open-source model rather than OpenAI
- Admin for Ryan:
    - Get Yi-Ling added to Reginald repo
    - Add Rosie to Azure subscription
    - Create regular calendar invite
