"What is the purpose of the ""Contributing"" section in the REG Handbook?","The purpose of the ""Contributing"" section in the REG Handbook is to provide a platform for individuals to discuss and share ideas related to the handbook. The section encourages open communication and collaboration, allowing participants to brainstorm, ask questions, and report any issues they encounter. By fostering an environment where people can freely express themselves, the Contributing section helps ensure that the handbook remains a dynamic and evolving resource.","Projects This section describes how we coordinate our project work. It does not go into details of how individual projects are managed, but how REG coordinates its commitments to the range of projects it’s involved in. ;Discussions and Issues Contributing does not only mean adding code or writing pages. Being involved in reporting issues and discussing ideas are important and valuable aspects to contributing. The handbook uses both issues and discussions on GitHub. Discussions The handbook Discussions
are the best place for informal talk about the handbook. You should feel welcome to create a discussion on any relevant topic, without the formality of an issue. Good examples of discussions are Any questions Possible bugs (does anyone else have this problem?) Chapter suggestions Looking for collaborators Community support Any other on-topic talk Issues The issue tracker is best used for development work. This is because issues integrate well with GitHub development tools like projects, pull requests, assignments and so on. Each issue should ideally represent a well-defined, self-contained piece of work suitable to become a single pull request. Good examples of issues are Bug reports with technical detail Developed chapter proposals Feature requests (such as new shortcodes) Specific ideas for changes When opening an issue, pick a suitable template (if any) to make the process easier.
